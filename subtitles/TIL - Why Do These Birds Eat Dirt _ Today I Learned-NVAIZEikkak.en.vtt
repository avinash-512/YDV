00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.069
When I'm really desperate for something salty
I’ll grab maybe a pickle or bag of potato

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.900
chips, but macaws, they grab a big old hunk
of dirt.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.060
All animals need salt, badly, for

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.120
basic biological function.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.300
Animals in the western Amazon are really deprived of salt

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:34.520
because the Andes actually block the weather
from the Pacific. So that means that all of

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.790
the weather comes from the Atlantic. By the
time that salty air gets all the way to the

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.750
western Amazon, most of that salt has already
fallen.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.440
So animals in the western Amazon are

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.850
really desperate for salt, and they'll go
to great lengths to get it. Macaws, in particular,

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.280
which are specialized for fruit in the very
highest part of the canopy will come all the

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:04.750
way down and they'll eat the dirt. They’re
selecting these very specific layers of soil

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.509
that were formed over geological time during
periods where conditions were a little bit

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:25.179
saltier than in the other times. It’s like
a vitamin, but it’s especially salty.

You scratch my back, I scratch yours… because
that’s why we have nails, right?

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.500
Hi guys, Lissette here on Dnews.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.670
So, we get a lot of questions from you on
Facebook, on YouTube, on Twitter.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.070
One that got us scratching our heads was Cynthia
Gutierrez’s Why Do We Have Nails?

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.070
Well…

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.640
The truth is scientists don’t really know
how our fingers came to have flat, thin covers

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.310
made of keratin on them.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.160
All we can say for certain is that we have
fingernails because our primate ancestors

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.230
had them and they were passed along to us.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.430
For some time, scientists theorized that our
nails were simply vestiges of ancestral claws,

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.969
but the scientific explanation has gotten
a lot messier and more complicated that.

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:45.389
Part of the reason it’s complicated is because
nails evolved more than 50 million years ago.

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:49.870
Like most others, this evolutionary trait
evolved slowly through natural selection over

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.629
a long period of time.

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.219
So scientists must rely on cues - like DNA,
the physical structure and characteristics

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.030
of fossils and bones, and phylogeny - where
certain animals fall in the tree of ancestors.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.530
What we do know is that nails on all fingers
are an exclusive characteristic of primates

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.130
- though similar keratinous structures like
hooves and horns exist in other animals too.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.140
The earliest evidence we have of fingernails
on primates comes from 55.8 million years

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.840
ago, according to a study published in the
American Journal of Physical Anthropology.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.060
Researchers discovered that a small lemur
like primate, less than six inches long, called

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.260
Teilhardina brandti, had nails on its digits
- Flat just like ours although they still

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.079
retained some claw-like features.

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:36.590
And, like us it was it was an omnivore, but
unlike most of us, it spent a good time up

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.850
in trees foraging.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.590
They posit that these nails were more useful
than claws to these little guys in certain

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.270
ways - like helping them hold onto smaller
branches - which could mean they would have

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.939
been better able to keep their balance a top
trees, which would have helped them forage

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:53.670
for food further, and kept them from falling
off the tree into the hands...uhhh claws…

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.180
of a hungry predator.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.290
The fact that these primates with bodies less
than 6 inches long had nails, has seriously

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.140
challenged the previous hypothesis that nails
evolved as primates bodies got larger.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.780
By pointing out that these nails gave the
primates an advantage, this evidence also

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.301
challenges the idea that we evolved nails
because the rounder, thicker claws simply

00:02:13.301 --> 00:02:14.310
became less useful.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.800
Still, it’s important to note that this
does not mean nails are categorically better

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.440
than claws, just better for certain things
for certain primates.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.690
Some researchers have even suggested that
the claw to nail relationship is not linear

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.530
- that some primates might have lost their
claws, evolved nails, and re-evolved claws

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.530
again.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.300
But regardless of why we got them in the first
place - there are a ton of reasons why we

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.450
have them today.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.180
Nails are useful in protecting the skin underneath
them and allows us to manipulate small objects

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.110
- they can make great little tweezers.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.600
Some scientists also believe they increase
the tactile sensitivity of our fingertips.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.880
And they can also serve as health indicators.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.700
For example, yellow nails could be the sign
of a fungal infection, which is very common

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.280
because some fungus loves to eat keratin.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.440
Yellowing could also signal something more
serious like diabetes or lung disease.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:06.110
And socially, nails have served to indicate
status or style for thousands of years - dating

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.840
back to the Chinese royalty in 3000 BCE and
the ancient Egyptians who differentiated class

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.170
by the color they painted their nails.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.550
So while the evolutionary role isn’t clear,
it is clear they play an important role in

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:20.760
cultural expression.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.970
Sponsorship
Another way to express yourself is through

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:23.970
a website.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.480
No domain extension will help you tell your
story like a DOT COM or DOT NET domain name.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.030

Have you noticed that the nails on your fingers

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.630
grow much faster than the nails on your toes?

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.270
Trace and Crystal have the skinny on that
here.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:56.130
Do your nails grow fast or slow?

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.470
Mine grow super fast.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:58.480
We love hearing from you.

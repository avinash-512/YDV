I have the opportunity to interview President bring up so the interview President Jimmy Carter first of all hot i turned 18 and then a month later I voted for him so even my first president that I ever voted for so that had a little special personal meaning to me that I could meet him but this is Startalk I'm not gonna ask him well what do you think about the developments in the Middle East that's what anyone else would ask about that now i'm not i'm not going there no no no starter is different this is jimmy carter I'm a scientist I'm asking i'm going to i would double check on how his geek credentials are coming along alright i said let's go back in time how much of a geek were you as a kid while he was up on a farm and all this peanut farming it's all real but he went to the Navy he learned nuclear physics and he taught astrophysics when he got two Navy shipman when he got out he was he's been interested in the universe from early on even interested in technologies and in science and this is influenced his life not only as a private citizen but as a public figure and of course he's very big on humanitarian causes as are so many people celebrities and the like what's different about him because he has the science analytic wiring of his brain he approaches the problem differently he's not just trying to fix this problem i need metrics measure my success here are my goals make this number mats that number by that time otherwise i have failed he's thinking about the world quantitatively and thinking about solutions scientifically this is what in part in my judgment has made him such a potent humanitarian it's not just I'm here fix it is lettuce design a plan that and will enable us to show people what got fixed and how well we fixed

in my field just as a scientist we view politics as a barrier between where we are and where we want to go but of course in Washington politics is the currency of interaction and so how do you as a professional politician balance what is objectively true about the world with what people want to be true yeah there's still a surprising number of people who don't believe in evolution right and the campaign against evolution has been politically amazingly successful and I think I'm a good red-blooded american and i will say i don't mind that you you just shouldn't be on a science committee making decisions that affect the entire country are rewriting our textbooks against we're 90 something percent of people are right the same thing is true with climate change it's inconvenient for some people so they just this about we may be those of us who believe in it may be wrong about how quickly adverse consequences would be manifest but I think with regard to science we at least have to get those people who have no interest in it to adopt what is now my mode of thinking the grandparent test that is you name me one other risk-related decision where if ninety-five percent of the experts were here and one to there any grandparents would stake his or her grandchild future on the five percent how about this pose a guy wrote one article and one journalist said you know I've been thinking about these child restraint seats and I think you know there's a one-in-a-million chance a kid could snap his neck so i recommend just going to get in the backseat and let them roll around and ninety-nine percent reveals that oh my god you can't do that these are working look at the help of the fatalities going to name me one grandparent who choose the one percent not one but that's what we do with climate change I mean my theory is nothing would create more new jobs and do it surprise and changing the way we produce and consume energy and other resources and if you can do it in a way that's good for the economy it's probably something you ought to do anyway scientists need to say look we're not being dogmatic if you can show us we're wrong we'll admit we're wrong wrong all the time we're still opening doors were opening doors were opening doors and that these fields of knowledge are coming together in ways that are beautiful

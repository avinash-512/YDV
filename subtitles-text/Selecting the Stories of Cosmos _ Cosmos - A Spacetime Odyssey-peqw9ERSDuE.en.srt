National Geographic Channel presents an exclusive deeper dive into cosmos every story in cosmos was chosen for the emotional content against all odds the struggle firing new of what it means to put above all things what is true you know it's always a challenge when you're going back into the past and looking at these characters from history who played such an important role in the development of science but about whom few people know much at all for example any jump cannon who was an astronomer nearly 20th century who developed the classification scheme that we still use for stars today remarkably little about her biography or backstory and so we just had to dig deep we went to Harvard went to their archives had an archivist fine material for us to make sure that it was properly sourced i think most of the greatest thoughts humans have ever conjured remain under celebrated today and it makes me wonder why is it that some other set of scientists are the ones we've all heard of you know Einstein new Darwin it's as though there was nobody else thinking about the world maybe it's because most science does not involve Eureka moments involves moments where the scientists are doing research that's odd there's some result they didn't expect that's harder to retail harder celebrate some of the greatest heroes in cosmos are completely unfounded it was a real privilege for me to get to tell their story

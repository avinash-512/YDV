yeah good size swarm they go Jesus look at them all they're still coming out of the entrance breathing it's honey season in the mountains of North Carolina homesteaders Tony and Amelia are banking on a major harvest this year I can really smell the honey yeah i know it smells like honey everywhere right now I want them to start looking for a new home before we catch him whoa that if you look up towards the sun PM bee swarm when they are ready to propagate themselves so they will take their population of let's say 10,000 and half of them will leave with a new queen I wonder if the Queen's out yet i'm watching for they go out find a new location to live in and they build themselves a new house in hopes that the next year they could have a swarm and do the same thing I think she's gonna land right in that tree yeah that's the spot she must be up in there somewhere and they go they're zeroing in on it that's almost landed it's a good-sized one so once we see them swarming the plan of action is to get an empty hi box there's this high get up into the tree where they swarmed into and not the swarm into the new hive every minute is a minute that the scouts are looking for a place to move to so the clock's ticking once they leave their mother colony oh oh oh my god you have two storms happening at the same time in the same tree swarms injury i've actually never seen this before twice the bees twice the risk yeah let's get let's get this one first yes the to swarm the right up against each other so this is a little sketchy we go one big risk is that we shake one branch and shakes the other branch and the other swarm falls off and lands on one of us can we go to your left just a little bit something goes wrong like they fall on your head or they fall on your body or they fall anywhere and just get really upset that's like thousands of bees all singing you at once going in very when you shake the one really hard shake it and that helps to ensure that the Queen comes off she's a minute

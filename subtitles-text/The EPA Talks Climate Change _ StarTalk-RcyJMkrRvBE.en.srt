climate change is that real presumably the EPA's ready to do something about it I went straight to Gina McCarthy the administrative EPA to find out what are they doing about climate change let's check it moving forward to develop a standard that will lower carbon pollution that's fueling climate change from power sector that companies that generate electricity it's extremely important for us to tackle it because they are the largest source of carbon pollution were you can't really we're doing it by developing a rule we put out a proposal is called out clean power plan and basically it's an effort for the federal government to look at the signs for EPA look at the Science and to say what kind of standards we can achieve over long-term to send a signal to the energy world that we need to meet shifting towards a low-carbon future but every state's going to translate that into their very own plan based on where they are today and that plan is going to be done in a way that meets their energy needs doesn't threaten reliability doesn't change the affordability of of energy for all of us no lights are gonna be shut out but we're gonna have actually head towards a low-carbon future in jobs of the future as well is that possible was added yeah there are no it's totally possible and it's happening a lot of the challenge with climate is that the costs come in the future and we have this bad habit of discounting future costs they they call it a discount rate that you apply to the future and again despite this is a scientist is that like people who smoke there like that's what I don't care love it that's right the real-time benefit whatever that might be outweighs the future future do that someone is doing this about

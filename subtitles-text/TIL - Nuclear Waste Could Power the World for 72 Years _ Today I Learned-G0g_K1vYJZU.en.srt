something that was so surprising to me when I started thinking about nuclear waste it was the amount of energy that's left in it so you could take all 270,000 metric tons of nuclear waste that exists worldwide and you can turn that into enough electricity to power the entire world for 72 years even taking into account increasing energy demand so it's just staggering and I think that we can start thinking of this nuclear waste and as a resource to be Jeb rather than a liability that we need to sweep under the rug yeah

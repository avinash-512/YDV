recently there's been a lot of excitement about this mysterious star and the the k2 data that the kepler space telescope data the star that has a bizarre dip in the amount of light that reaches the Earth there's a chance that maybe the dip in the light is caused by an alien mega-structure that's being constructed around this parent star and that structure would then cause the light to dip as it orbits the parent star now this idea of giant alien megastructures has been around for a long time and basically the idea here is that you're a growing civilization in a solar system you want to capture all of the energy from your parent star want to put solar panels or whatever in a shell around that star so you can grow and grow and not be limited by the amount of energy and so there are some out there that are speculating that maybe what we're seeing is one of these advanced civilizations in the process of building up this shell and the dips never seen correspond to that she'll rotating in out of our view now this is a far-out and extraordinary hypothesis but something we can't quite rule out yet so the next step is that the settings to will use some of its radio telescopes to see whether or not there any radio signals coming with messages for planet Earth I'm skeptical and I said probably not but the little kid and make sure hopes that is what's going on

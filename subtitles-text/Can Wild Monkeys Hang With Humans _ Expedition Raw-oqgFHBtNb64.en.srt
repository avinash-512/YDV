macaque seen humans have been coexisting in Gibraltar for at least centuries they know where to go and when for these interactions the tourists and they get fed those are almost like stage shows at the theater Shh but they have another life they go off to their so-called real life Shh and that's what we're trying to understand what the critter cam is what's going on in the rest of that life well they got a critter cam on a macaque react to catch the macaque the mechanics are not stupid they can see the trap but as I was sitting there waiting I looked over to my side and I saw Dale leaning on the wall has been working at the research team that brought her for over 10 years I saw this macaque walk down the wall and sit down right next to him and i just realized i had to catch that this was like two acquaintances and yeah the macaque wanna see if they'll maybe had a peanut on it but it was kinda like two people sitting US top and one asking the other if you can from cigarette wasn't the kind of frenetic and more anxious interaction you get between the tourists and the mechanics seeing that moment with Dale in macaque made me realize that the coexistence here was deeper more profound than I'd ever thought

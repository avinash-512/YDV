one thing that's really important to me in the kitchen is to have all my knives really sharp so I want to teach you how to sharpen your own knives in your own kitchen first step is to get a sharpening stone one side with more ruff grains the opposite side has smoother grains so once you get your hand in the knife set at a certain angle just keep it up that angle throughout the sharpening process so I'm just going to start making circles here and i'm going to start at the tip and just move to the middle and then down to the bottom and then just kind of go back and forth i'm going to turn to the smooth side do the same thing mysteries like this for a few seconds at the end just do one clean swipe each direction there's a very shiny sharp knife you can tell the part that's been sharpened because it's super shiny looks like brand-new metal and then if you want to test to make sure its sharp just rub it on your fingernail for a second if it easily scrapes off little little pieces of fingernail dust and it's short and it's ready to use so now that I have this knife sharpened i can go and very confidently use it to cut anything I want to like meet once you learn how to sharpen a it really makes cooking a lot more enjoyable

Seether cut wood or go get a job make money and buy oil I'd much rather go to cut wood yeah that's true the leaner and definitely the wrong way but at least I don't have to worry about dropping it on the dogs that kind of stuck in trees are leaning they can only go one direction so you're at the mercy of the lien of the tree you just don't want to come down trees hang up sometimes multiple times and it makes for a lot more work everything everywhere I dropped I think for trees just to try and get it to where I could cut it up for firewood I'll get back in there and stumble around and try and get the rest of the wood another day hundred fifty hundred pounds hundred fifty pounds it's not too bad it has to be enough wood for probably five days ok

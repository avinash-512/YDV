one thing I bet you didn't know is that every time you wash your fleece jacket 2,000 pieces of plastic it shed right into the waterway the plastics are so small you can't see with your naked eye they're called micro plastics these tiny little plastics as they float their way down the rivers and into our oceans they're picking up different chemicals they act like little sponges picking up DDT and BPA and pseudo estrogens that matters because the fish and other marine life that think that it's plankton wind up eating those plastics bigger fish eat those fish and eventually the fish make their way on our dinner tables and into our beer we've had plastic show up in german beer this year it's showing up in honey it's showing up in different food products that should not be contaminated with plastics what we've learned over the last few years what the science community has learned over the last few years is that this is getting into the water from washing your fleece jackets it's washing your synthetic clothings in general it's coming from the micro beads that are in your face washes the little blue things that show up in your toothpaste that we think of as these miracle scrubbers and hold their plastics and you're putting plastics into your mouth into your bloodstream and then they make their way into our oceans and into the bloodstream of the planet

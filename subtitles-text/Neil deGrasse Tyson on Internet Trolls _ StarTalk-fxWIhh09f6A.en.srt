I have an unorthodox view of trolls on the internet I value the fact that we live in a free country which generally means among other freedoms at the top of the list freedom of speech so here's for me I'd rather know you think that way and you tell me so then I never know that at all yet you're still sitting there in front of the information has value to me so I you know it here the only trolls I get angry with there is a subject thread and then they want to troll about something and nothing to do with the subject three if you're gonna troll stay on topic just stay on topic because i can't chase you wherever you're going around the universe ok but Ariana made an important point she said if if you're going to contribute on these pages to contribute under your real name control don't hide we don't need you what are you doing be if you really feel that tell us and let us know who you are she found out that when you are required to divulge your identity patrolling dropped so maybe that's the way to do it that's if I want to know you feel that way I have to know that you know someone else are some  anonymous person about where I can't have a conversation can come to an anonymous person I wanna know who you are you come from and let's have a psychologists have known for decades for most of the century that if you if you close yourself in anonymity your the your penchant for being nastier and meaner grows and it's an odd arts a fault of human nature natural we should recognize them and do what we can to overcome it to rise above you can say well it's human nature while civilization is what we've created for ourselves by overcoming what might otherwise have been human nature

the largest migration on the planet happens every day and it happens in the ocean so you know how people have fish finders we have things like that on oceanographic research vessels that use sound to look at particles in the water and you can see these particles moving up through the water at different times and back down and others and it's plankton vertically migrating to the surface each light dinner animals that tend to drift around the current but they do have the ability to move up and down through the water column - during the daytime they want to be in water where it starts so they can be seen but at night they moved to the surface where they can buy the things that they eat where hopefully things will eat them don't see them this happens all around the planet in every ocean it's amazing

yeah what we strove to do when any filmmaker should strive to do when you're doing a period piece is to be authentic and to be absolutely real raw hides ok stagecoach role in the crowd where you hit we took great pains and being historically accurate we had two different teams and national geographic who are at my disposal making sure that I got everything right you know there's a certain amount of artistic license of writers take we came up with the story that is engaging and at the same time as flawless beautiful research get close awfully so a couple of months after the assassination attempt all the doctors and all the nurses that one saving his life they put together their own little mini documentary they reenacted everything exactly as it happened and so this became extraordinarily valuable to us mr. president today we're all I think the thing that we've been blessed with on all of our killing Productions is foremost writers who are incredibly fast with material and deeply familiar with it and so that they can again take something that we already have some basic walking knowledge of and transcend that were exposed to those things we recognize and yet we get a different perspective on them I don't think we even realize when we tasked with Cynthia how truly lucky we were to have two people who were equally committed deeply researched these roles and who have such an alluring and sort of complex relationships that were able to build on screen together Eric Simonson both is the a trickle background as a writer and a director I think was able to bring to this sort of a dynamic that gave us an immediacy in terms of our experience of this . history and then with rod Lori who is a director at the top of his form but one who thrives in this political forum in between the two of them there was such a deep foundation of understanding and determination to tell the story as authentically as fully as dramatically as possible and that to me is also what defines doing a piece like this for National Geographic

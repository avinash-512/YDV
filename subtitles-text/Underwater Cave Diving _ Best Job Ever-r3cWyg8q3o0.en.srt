when you tell people that you you do cave diving and say oh you must be an adrenaline junkie but in fact it's the exact opposite when i get underground underwater it's a hundred percent focus and all you hear is really the sound of your own breath and you're you're in kind of a for me what some people call the flow or the zend it's this whole experience of columns when all is going well all systems go you just feel like really you're on this magic carpet ride through the underworld you know the flipside of being this otherworldly environment the danger and it's a pretty good challenges to go into an underwater cave and come out alive I've had a lot of friends who died in these kids in the moment you don't let these outside thoughts come in about stream danger you really just focus on making sure all your systems are going on navigating and then you start adding the science the filming collecting data taking pictures different sorts of sampling it's really a multitasking challenge when people ask me what I like best about going to a cable what's the neatest thing you found it's less what I found the experience i guess the greatest thing I ever found under water was an ability to keep myself calm and I try to take that and bring it to the surface I'm realizing that we're really just scratching the surface of what is really here I didn't expect anything that beautiful to exist

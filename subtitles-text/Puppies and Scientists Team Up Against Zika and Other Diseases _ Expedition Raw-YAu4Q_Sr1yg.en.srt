oh yeah the bees are absolutely critical to the research but ok lucky we are collecting blood sucking creatures like fleas and mosquitoes because they transmitted disease to humans like dengue virus Zika bubonic plague or bartonella so what are the most fun parts about this expedition is that we get to me all sorts of great kids and they quickly bring us to all the puppies and nice dogs in the village I'm now known as the flea hunter of the Amazon and I'm a very hairy person and so sometimes you see a flea running through your hair it's a little bit disgusting are you all up here we're going to use at the tougher the coca that's why I really try to have an appt collected many slaves as possible and I stick the mosquito captures come on kid we're getting our me as we speak with the mosquito captures nick and i will just walk into the jungle and stand there away from mosquitoes to land on each of us and then we suck them off of each other with aspirators us trapped in your body hair and now the perfect bait on my worst day I have probably received five hundred vice just myself almost we will use DNA sequencing to look at thousands of these insects and each one will likely have unique bacteria living inside them that has not been discovered previously well that's just beautiful what even like why I hope that we can figure out how the factory that live in these creatures how they are distributed across the Amazon and hopefully that information will help us better predict which communities are most at risk for future outbreaks of disease I don't think I'll ever get used to putting my finger up a water bug famous all right people just when you get a pickle sample you don't mess around just want to be as thorough as

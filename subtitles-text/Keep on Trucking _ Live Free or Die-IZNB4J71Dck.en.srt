hey james paton I bird fresh off a scavenging trip with the local junkyard homesteaders Tony and Amelia drop in on farmer james truck huh say these trucks just sit around got three trucks down here are you gonna put a truck bed back on that the truck and some of these days are any of these trucks running over here you got you gotta travel apps truck yard over here why yellow in the market for a trip up the market for a truck for 20 years but I'm truck and you managed to Dan one that works when it works cheap one anything that runs and has a big truck bed that we can haul stuff around and we can collect collect ano junk and lumber and use materials same reason why you got a truck or three of them for that matter well with why here and looked dazed and the door works this runs on gas yeah we want a big diesel truck we can convert it to run on vegetable oil because then it would be free to drive the thing which is crazy every year three billion gallons of waste vegetable oil or french fry oil is tossed out but if that waste was converted to biodiesel he could provide enough fuel to run almost a half a million cars for a hundred and fifty thousand miles each well I've got one up at the bar and a part that runs on basically oh really yeah we go up to tomorrow and take a look at that when you say if you've got me interested met her I've got more the hair collection then I need you know yeah this map they just what you're looking for town alright let's have a look at this truck yeah that batteries day we don't have a battery put in for you see where you're lacking out again do you know anything about the engine in this thing I just knows a good engine well that's me i shall I knew just drive yeah oh right let's see it's got a big long truck bed this is perfect and our lives would change of the office thing you imagine how much stuff we could scavenge there's nothing I don't like about it except for that it's not running so as long as we can get it running I mean it's perfect maybe we could call the mechanic I guess I just work all day and get him ok we can put the battery in and it starts up then great I'm skeptical there's gotta be something wrong with it there's always something wrong vehicles

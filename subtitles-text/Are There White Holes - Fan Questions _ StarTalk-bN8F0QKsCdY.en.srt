white holes are curious mathematical opposites of black holes and they were discovered mathematically in i think the early nineteen seventies when black hole mathematics was maturing you have the idea how do you make it work you go through the equations about it being here is this black hole it works is predicted by Einstein's relativity he didn't predict it didn't keep using his own theories and equations he did not go there because it was too extreme even for Einstein to reach we land there in the early nineteen seventies late nineteen sixties here's a black hole region of space nothing comes out ever it's a collapse region of space time and we have evidence for them in the Centers of galaxies as endpoints of the death of stars at the time you realize you can take the equation that give you a black hole and you realize it turns out there's another solution to those it's not that complicated to imagine if I had if i say i take the number nine and I ask you what's the square root of mine would you tell me it's a 33 times three is nine to three squared is 9 square root of nine is three so we got that it so the answer to the question what is the square design is three however I now ask you what is negative 3 times negative 3 it's also nine so in fact the the square root of nine has two solutions three and negatively you're both legitimate solutions to that question one is not more better than the other the equations that give you a black hole is a second solution to it the mathematical opposite of the black hole where everything only ever comes out of it what possible other word would be picked for this a white hole early seventies people said I we got this what would my whole look like is there evidence for one in the universe we train the telescopes on the use found not right now white holes are are in the repository of science fiction ideas that you might want to do something with or not but there's no evidence for them as being real objects in our known

Oh get out of here you stupid mosquito well I don't want your stupid diseases hey guys Julia here for dnews mosquitoes are often seen as one of the most annoying creatures on this planet and arguably one of the most deadly these buzzing nuisances carry deadly diseases like yellow fever dengue fever lymphatic filariasis and famously malaria according to the world health organization malaria effects over 500 million people a year and kills three million so why are mosquitoes such good carriers of disease especially well interestingly hashtag not all mosquitoes of the three thousand species of mosquitoes only three of them seem to be the one spreading most of the human diseases were familiar with and often these mosquitoes carry malaria filariasis and encephalitis and inflammation of the brain Culex mosquitoes carry encephalitis filariasis and the West Nile virus and aedes yellow fever and dengue fever in fact many species of mosquitoes aren't good carriers of disease at all according to dr. Kennedy Bernick microbiologist at the University of Minnesota most mosquitoes are malaria resistant and the susceptible ones are the oddballs most mosquitoes actually fight malaria with their immune responses to parasites after a mosquito sucks up its bloody meal a parrot robic matrix or barrier forms in between the bugs lining of their mid get and the blood when we can take a few hours to form it does trap some parasites inside possibly providing protection against some of them the malaria parasite doesn't infect mosquitoes at all it never entered their circulatory system another response mosquitoes have is to coat the parasite in a melon capsule but this comes at a cost mosquito has to commit resources to coat the invader which takes resources away from things like reproduction resulting in the infected mosquitoes becoming less fertile so the parasite can enter the mosquitoes body and often doesn't make them sick which is good news for the parasite or a virus because of their host dies they die too malaria's next trick is getting from the mosquito into a human body probably yours the parasite uses some of the very things that helped a mosquito feed to easily enter the next host mosquitoes have substances in their saliva that we can blood vessels promote bleeding and shut down human body's natural first line of defense these evolutionary advantages help invaders slip into their next host with an injection directly into the bloodstream they bypass a lot of immune defenses and some parasites actually change of mosquitoes behavior to make it easier for them to achieve this goal one study in PLoS ONE found that malaria makes humans smell more attractive to mosquitoes and another study published in the American Journal tropical medicine and hygiene and the malaria makes mosquitoes feed longer and invades the mosquitoes salivary glands while in the sporozoite stage which probably helps the parasite get into the next host easier but in their invasion they interfere with the mosquito saliva production which the mosquito needs to locate blood vessels in a host with impaired salivary abilities it takes longer for the mosquitoes feed to get the same amount of blood which is just fine with the parasite it gives them more time to jump to their new host so the mosquitoes are good at varying parasites like malaria to our bloodstream they don't benefit from their more but task and instead put themselves in more danger and can become infertile the saying goes don't kill the messenger but in this case you should totally kill the I agree with one Cornell University researcher who called mosquitoes the most vile and useless species on the planet why don't we just get rid of them all well trace an Italian financer in this episode right a world without mosquitoes sounds like it doesn't suck but what purpose do mosquitoes actually serve don't they have to have a purpose not really actually they exist because they haven't gone extinct yet alright guys so how do you feel about mosquitoes would you kill them all or do you think they're useful in some way let me know down in the comments below and don't forget to hit those like and subscribe buttons and keep coming back to dnews so you don't miss a single episode

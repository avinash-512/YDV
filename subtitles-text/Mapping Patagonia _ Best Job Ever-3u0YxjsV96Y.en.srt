Marty and I set out on an expedition to make the first print and interactive maps of Patagonia national park this was a dream project in Patagonia we wanted to explore as much of the park as we could so that meant bushwhacking off trails that meant you know scrambling blue deep brush or crossing tons of streams that are ice cold and you know that was part of the exploration and part of the adventure of the project when we were climbing up some of these remote peaks spend hours going across screen fields just to get to the summit get to this beautiful overlooking and see what it's like up there and create maybe a 360Â° panorama and the real goal was to give people an on-the-ground perspective what it's like to stand in the park itself and I mean look at that doesn't get much better than that every day's different what I love most about Patagonia is no two days are the same the weather is constantly changing the light is constantly changing never know what the sunrise or sunset or anything in between will hold and then we get to come back and produce a beautiful map that represents this place and you know share that with other people that's really why I do it the ice fishing reel yeah

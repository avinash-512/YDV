what do you think of a nice chilly check when we go in alright one out I think we were fishing I mean really so far on this trip we've already lost two paychecks and the top it off I still haven't been paid for the first three fish we caught this season when we got to see every night with one on land why you busting my balls all he said it would be nice to get a fish Jack we go in today will stay in and I'll write checks will stay until the day I go next and choose is also acting like a jerk being a good captain is not just about putting fish in the boat it's also about honoring your commitments to your crew which includes paying them on time message days vision so we know right chaps I did noah takes a whole data write a check by I usually write a little quicker than that how going right now that's what well though I gotta deal with this Baltimore simple thing and you flipped up every time I bring up money and get all mad like I'm just talking to you is it wrong for me to worry about how I'm gonna feed my daughter Paul is out wrong there's no way you can go home until your five-year-old daughter that daddy didn't make any money this week so show up to go without dinner plans wants his money right now to feed his daughter so right man for my money I've never ever had anyone questioned me with money in my life I'm starting to see a different side of Paul in its aside appalled that I don't like getting bad

typically jewelweed and IV kind of grow right next to each other and jewelry it is aw awesome at helping with poison ivy I'll tell you how to determine whether it's jewelweed where it kind of gets its name hold it under water and it'll shimmer just like a little diamond it's really cool stuff that's about enough for me for right now there's just tons of juice in here and I can make basically a protective layer with this and I'm constantly exposing my skin to IV out here everywhere let them stand and a lot of every panel after I'm finished walking through IV or doing what I need to do and go wash this whole thing off in the creek and I don't get any reaction now I've got a barrier between me and the poison ivy

so I asked Chris what's it like to have flown before social media and then why in the error social times are different so I just asked Christer reflect on the difference between then and now when you're asked to do something I'll be out like to buy a share the experience was the right way my first flight grab the camera this is a 1995 Hasselblad seventy millimeter film it right take a picture up someplace and first thing is what was a good picture not to get the a stop to get everything just I don't know see your bracket you hope and then you get home in a few weeks later they have this big roll of film and you're looking at what the heck is that and you know I think that picture is OK and then make your printer video yeah that's a nice i'd like a slightly San endemic use light and now you have this little tiny slide some place on earth and now how do you are you show that to the person that it's interesting to now on the station just with the old days with social media you can grab onto the cameras on board take a picture someplace cool click belligerency computer and on Twitter immediately say not just two people from that place but around the whole world say look at this look at this place and the power that was amazing to watch stuff happens so fast on a space station you're going to a quick around the world is an excellent Space Place and often YouTube had a goal that was amazing but I don't have time to think but right now I'm gonna I just have to shell my reaction to that think I may take pictures or something and later on when I think about it and I still was delayed emotional investment you have to you have to you can't keep up you just overwhelm you if you try to keep up mostly with what's happening especially journal shows like but even on a space station fly if if if you and I were by the big window on the space station and I when we went around the world once you get what would I show you what would you look at this look what's coming look up ahead at Melton acker look we do we get to talk your look what we're gonna see online and France 15 seconds later cool would you say that social media has boosted public interest in space I think I can look at all your numbers art most astronauts have a twitter handle rajko everyone knows everyone for at nasa had 8.7 million follow your up the Mars Curiosity rover the rover has 1.8 million followers more than hatfield or millions you I look like most other parts

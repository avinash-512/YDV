we raised a lot of baby chicks here and one really important thing is to make sure that they have access to water and to make sure that they can't drown in the water so i'm going to show you today how to make a chick water that is safe for very very small checks what I like to do is use a shallow tray like this and then use another container that will also hold water so the first thing I'm going to do is poke some holes in the bottom of this container i'm going to place it on the plate here and just make sure I poke the hole below the top level of where I want the water to be so now that I have all my holes in this jug i'm going to go ahead and put some water in the tray and then I'm gonna fill this jug with water as well I filled the jug all the way up and i'm going to put the cap on and then set it down in the water when the water level gets down to the holes the water will refill the train back up all right let's get the chicky some water what that's what

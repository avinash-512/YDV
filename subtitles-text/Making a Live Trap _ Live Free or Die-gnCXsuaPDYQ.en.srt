thorns girlfriend Delia's counting on him to make sure they stay stocked up on meat but he's new trapping still doesn't have a handle on the habits of all the wildlife in the area now I'm gonna actually make a live trap  it's kind of like a primitive cage I'll have some pretty strong greenwood that will be like a box and lace it all together there's a lot more work that goes into having enough for two people and we're both providing in our way but as far as shelters concerned and the hunting side of things it's pretty much on my shoulders yeah that's heavy they're not lifted now I just gotta set it i've found that food is really the biggest obstacle to that really deep wildlife that I'm looking for this edge right here walked it often and seeing a lot of rabbit moving in and out abate the set with little bit Apple animal go in there after the apple and trigger it a whole box or just right on top of the traps find that sweet spot I'm so close shoot you don't make traps and and set them and put them in the right places as a little bit of a learning curve for me so I've got to use all my knowledge of these animals and their behavior and their pattern and hopefully I can get some meat that way all it's about a hair-trigger so anything that touches that possum rabbit Coon whatever I don't care

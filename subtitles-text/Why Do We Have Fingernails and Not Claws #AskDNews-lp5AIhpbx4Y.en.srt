You scratch my back, I scratch yours… because  that’s why we have nails, right? Hi guys, Lissette here on Dnews. So, we get a lot of questions from you on  Facebook, on YouTube, on Twitter. One that got us scratching our heads was Cynthia  Gutierrez’s Why Do We Have Nails? Well… The truth is scientists don’t really know  how our fingers came to have flat, thin covers made of keratin on them. All we can say for certain is that we have  fingernails because our primate ancestors had them and they were passed along to us. For some time, scientists theorized that our  nails were simply vestiges of ancestral claws, but the scientific explanation has gotten  a lot messier and more complicated that. Part of the reason it’s complicated is because  nails evolved more than 50 million years ago. Like most others, this evolutionary trait  evolved slowly through natural selection over a long period of time. So scientists must rely on cues - like DNA,  the physical structure and characteristics of fossils and bones, and phylogeny - where  certain animals fall in the tree of ancestors. What we do know is that nails on all fingers  are an exclusive characteristic of primates - though similar keratinous structures like  hooves and horns exist in other animals too. The earliest evidence we have of fingernails  on primates comes from 55.8 million years ago, according to a study published in the  American Journal of Physical Anthropology. Researchers discovered that a small lemur  like primate, less than six inches long, called Teilhardina brandti, had nails on its digits  - Flat just like ours although they still retained some claw-like features. And, like us it was it was an omnivore, but  unlike most of us, it spent a good time up in trees foraging. They posit that these nails were more useful  than claws to these little guys in certain ways - like helping them hold onto smaller  branches - which could mean they would have been better able to keep their balance a top  trees, which would have helped them forage for food further, and kept them from falling  off the tree into the hands...uhhh claws… of a hungry predator. The fact that these primates with bodies less  than 6 inches long had nails, has seriously challenged the previous hypothesis that nails  evolved as primates bodies got larger. By pointing out that these nails gave the  primates an advantage, this evidence also challenges the idea that we evolved nails  because the rounder, thicker claws simply became less useful. Still, it’s important to note that this  does not mean nails are categorically better than claws, just better for certain things  for certain primates. Some researchers have even suggested that  the claw to nail relationship is not linear - that some primates might have lost their  claws, evolved nails, and re-evolved claws again. But regardless of why we got them in the first  place - there are a ton of reasons why we have them today. Nails are useful in protecting the skin underneath  them and allows us to manipulate small objects - they can make great little tweezers. Some scientists also believe they increase  the tactile sensitivity of our fingertips. And they can also serve as health indicators. For example, yellow nails could be the sign  of a fungal infection, which is very common because some fungus loves to eat keratin. Yellowing could also signal something more  serious like diabetes or lung disease. And socially, nails have served to indicate  status or style for thousands of years - dating back to the Chinese royalty in 3000 BCE and  the ancient Egyptians who differentiated class by the color they painted their nails. So while the evolutionary role isn’t clear,  it is clear they play an important role in cultural expression. Sponsorship  Another way to express yourself is through a website.

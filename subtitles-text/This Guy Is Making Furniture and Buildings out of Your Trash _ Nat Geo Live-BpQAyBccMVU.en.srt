like a plastic that's why we engulfed on the 15-year missions who turn that into something that we actually want we have collected around 750 new materials that's coming from our daily post-consumer waste it can go into any consumer product at lower costs higher performance / so let me show of hands who actually recycled something today wow ok this is a we-we're audience but guess what guess what there's actually in the United States we have a lowest recycling rate of all the developed nations is plateauing at thirty-four percent recycling rate you look at the waist here it has tires a pair waste on top of plastic bags and PT bottles i think this is the one of a big problem here no one actually wants to be responsible for all that way so we're creating we are responsible all of us here are responsible for this mess our solutions we have to make trash sexy and this is what National Geographic is so good about for us engineer that is engineering porn okay so why is that because this is the highest performance animal in the ocean it's the fastest it has the scale that's optimized for speed and just the pure physical form is no waste zero-waste everything is considered everything is design but this is what we get every grain of rice every week every breath you eat has twenty percent ways fiber ways every PT bottle all these are perfectly non-toxic material that can constantly recycle reuse and then we have a growing it weighs electronic was huge amount of it has precious metal and have a lot of toxic element let me get nerdy little here ok why we are not turning that into product today if you touch your clothes there's no recycled content in it there's the seat you're sitting on the environment that we're in has no this is a problem why why not the reason is because the polymer chain got broken into recycling process this then how do you make them strong again if you're weak animal weekend i cannot be sexy maybe they are but but you know they're not very sexy so we we appeal we are actually drawn to pretty things so how do you make that sexy again we have to use fiber to bridge in between and this is a we go back to history the Romans built cement aqueducts Chinese build walls all with agricultural ways grind it down into these powder form they mix into the cement what it does is a have silicon dioxide in it amorphous silicon dioxide it's a natural glue it's actually forming these broken polymer chain if you mix into it actually start to come together conglomerates in too much much stronger materials the ancient does it why are we doing that today so that's one of the solution how we reinforced material using organic waste so why we're doing toxicities this is a piece of leather and that's a piece of recycle PT fabric on the side just look at how many steps required to produce a process a piece of leather fabric versus a piece of recycle PT waste every step required carbon footprint energy chemical on the recycle pd so you only use water heat and knife to cut the pieces down why are we doing this moral we embed seven new materials a month we have a collected around from our daily com post-consumer waste but the problem is no one wants to buy them ok so we have the pioneer making up new applications so i'll show you very quickly what we did this is what we call molecular cooking molecular cooking are all levels molecular gastronomy at the marketing front new pioneering engineering and designing and marketing front it can go into costs higher performance we have 40 Story Tower with trash campuses nice story tall building museum which is finished biggest waste recycling plant that we turn the ways of a waste into all the building structure we have work on the food waste recycling plant in taiwan and we also doing a car waste recycling plant that's finishing this year this looks like a piece of marble it's not it's right here it's a piece of recycle ET non woven no chemical added heat press structural material and it's also a air purifier ok may from cigarette ways which is tobacco which I spoke for many years ok it can be formed shape into a lot different format we turn into this in Milan this year this is a pavilion it's actually a inspired by the natural long molecule and that's actually capturing for model high in the air and it's integrated electronics it's all interlocked single material no glue and I want you to focus on the waist of the waste of that cigarette butt production process which are those chairs we actually turn that into these furniture product using the cigarette butts so the project called anything but ok and this process allows other designer cool will lead to even more different type of furniture products please this has to look sexy to you now because this is the leftover of a typical german beer festival okay look at all that material that's out there this is a possibility here and we turn that all that crap he waste food waste recycle nike shoes in to recycle nike store in New York you can go see in Paris lemery you can go see in Milan London you can see all these stores that's made from a pair of ways and he weighs and anyways we scale across 23 countries taking portable manufacturing machineries into developed world because want to keep the trash in the developed world not to ship to India China Taiwan anywhere else thank you apolline means the garbage people but the funny thing is that they don't believe there's such thing as garbage they see value and things that other people can't see the value and they're very proud of you

I think one of the most exciting things that people don't really realize is that birds are living dinosaurs and dinosaurs giving rise to birds probably did the same thing that birds to and virtually all birds use their feathers for display you think about a triceratops something they have his huge fan basically on the back of their head and there's no evidence that Triceratops used its horns for any kind of aggressive behavior because as they got bigger and bigger their horns became hollow and their shields became very thin they were probably all for display and cuz they're displaying very much liked Birds more than likely dinosaurs dance like birds kind of dances that you might imagine with dinosaurs they would be spectacular looking and it would be spectacular motion it's all speculation trying to figure out how they're going to display but that's pretty cool if you look at the brain it looks like multiple Grand Canyon's if you look at a mouse-brain you don't see that it's very smooth the outer mantle of the brain the cortex is very smooth and mouse but we have all these grooves and valleys in human brain

mmm i have a weird craving for liver and fava beans hey hungry fans Julia here for dnews cannibalism if you're a Hannibal fan you're not squeamish around the subject of people eating other people but it's one of the biggest taboos in human history but not in nature sometimes it's a family affair mother's eat babies babies feed off mom or a mom eats dad other times it's warring factions of the same species like chimps in Gombe National Park who ate neighboring groups offspring as described in a study published in the journal nature but I don't humans do it well simply put it's not socially acceptable come on just the thought of it is repulsive and with good reason it can cause nasty diseases like prion disease which we know that's Crutchfield's yeah cups disease or mad cow disease prion disease is caused from a Miss folding protein molecules in the brain which can happen for a variety of reasons like a fluke genetics or eating contaminated meat the misfolded proteins will spread until the brain is basically transformed into a sponge riddled with holes and eats away at memory causes seizures and it's ultimately fatal while incredibly rare now prior diseases might have been more common in history this is where things get interesting prion diseases might be rare now thanks to cannibalism you see researchers found that a tribe in Papua New Guinea has a genetic mutation that protects them from prion disease the tribe used to practice funerary cannibalism where members of the tribe would eat the remains of the deceased rather than burning them the men would eat the best meet the media muscles while women and children ate less good meet the brain and not surprisingly they were devastated by an epidemic of what they called kuru of prion disease at its peak in the nineteen fifties the epidemic kill two percent of the population every year as the tri became westernized the cannibalism stopping cool began to fade into memory but those that were left behind developed and genetic resistance to prion disease according to a study published in the journal Nature the study found that this resistance is the result of the mutation where the body produces an amino acid valine rather than the more common glycine this change prevents proteins in the brain from producing this old prions but a similar mutation might have appeared before and often a study published in the journal Science showed a different mutation in the same tribe that also prevented prion disease in another way but more shockingly they found widespread evidence of this mutation was found in most humans from Europe to Japan the researchers suggest that most early humans practice some form of cannibalism and probably suffered massive epidemics of prion diseases and hence why a large portion of the world's population now has some protection from these diseases but protection from diseases and the only benefit to cannibalism Journal of human evolution researchers found that 800,000 years ago our ancestors killed and ate the young of neighboring tribes as part of a territorial defense strategy as the young of the neighborhood group wanders far from home they might attack and kill the young as a kind of warning to the other group the sort of defense strategy can be seen today in some populations of chimpanzees the defensive more fair are the only reasons for cannibalism simple hunger might drive people to dine on their neighbors another study published in the Journal of human evolution suggested that eating a group member can help conserve energy one of the lead authors of the study told Discovery News the body can give one day off from hunting which was always dangerous at that time and I mean human body contains a lot of calories according to James Cole a professor on human origins at the University of Brighton puts the calorie count of the human body at about 80 1,500 calories so that's fun news day now as you watch Hannibal you can be proud that it celebrates our heritage oh man nope it's still extremely disturbing well you might be grossed out by cannibalism some new moms are eating their placentas to get the whole sticky scoop check out this video right here humans are among the few animals who don't practice placenta faiza almost all land mammals eat there after birth and that fact is a common one that people cite when they do go on to eat their placentas so there you have it folks humans once ate other humans love to break down the weird stuff here at dnews so if you've got any weird questions floating around in that brain of yours leave them down in the comments below don't forget to hit those like and subscribe buttons and keep going back dnews so you don't miss a single episode

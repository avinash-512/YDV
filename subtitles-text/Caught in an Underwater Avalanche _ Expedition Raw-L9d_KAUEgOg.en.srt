we're heading down to explore an underwater cave we always run a guideline you place it very carefully because you have to assume that you're going to come out in no visibility without that line you have low odds to get now and then all of a sudden it just started raining down on top of me one of us are all of us just the are in kicks or just the pressure waves of our body must have set off this abalones my initial reaction was to just scream in my own head we trained ourselves to take slow deep breaths into your heart rate down the last thing I look for is where was my dive partner and we're with the line be i found the line and then Brian's leg and gave him the push forward signal lucky that it was a very narrow passageway using a giant passage where I wouldn't hit the line you're spending a long time completely concentrated with no it's only when you get for the surface and you see all your your dive buddies next you realize just how how intense experience you just went through one of the most tense 78 hits the next event a long time

right there dude that's the dude ok this teeth my bag this you think he's gonna eat me we finally got through the coyote night I'm laying in my bag I feel this little yank on my sleeping bag and look out there and there's a coyote like at the foot of my sleeping bag isn't that insane if you bit in the right place and sleeping back you were like bit my foot since corrected the tent like I see the two years oven such as something that's my stomach and so I kind of sit up and immediately see something kind of scurry off and if you only screws off like five more feet he's still like sitting there staring at me like and my gut instinct was just to do that kind of God but I was freaked

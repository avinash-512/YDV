Amelia's Turkey Tail Tea _ Live Free or Die  How to Homestead yeah hi there these are turkey tail mushrooms so turkey tail is one of our favorites they are easy to identify pick a piece and I look on the underside and if the underside has pores in it because which are lots and lots of teeny tiny holes then it's turkey tail the top of the mushroom has stripes on it and the reason that it's called the turkey tail is because the mushroom actually looks like a turkey tail with the with the colors in the shape of it I'm going to pick a bunch of them I'm just going to pick enough for a couple cups of tea for Tony and I there's no need to harvest more than I need for a day because they are so plentiful and they pretty much can be picked year round so this is enough mushrooms to make some tea for Tony and I this evening what I'm going to do next is just kind of wipe off the dirt mushrooms that grow outside of Chris tend to a little dirt on all right so these are nice and clean it's going to kind of hear them up into this pot it's good determined to pretty small pieces because the smaller the the more surface area on the mushroom which allows more of the medicine to be pulled out when it's being something alright got this all broken up now i'm going to put just a few cups of water in here because I'm just making a couple cups for Tony and I now I have my water in here i am going to bring it to a simmer and let it simmer for about 15 minutes you don't want to boil the turkey tail you just want to simmer it if you if you get it too hot you can actually destroy some of the nutrients so kind of a long slow 15 minutes summers is ideal ok so it's been about 15 minutes and this turkey tail tea is ready to drink and pour the whole thing with the mushrooms this handy little strainer kuch touches pitches all the mushrooms okay go ahead and pour a few small cups that allows the tita to stay warmer longer so just pour several small cups instead of one big cup and leave most the team here to stay warm mmm definitely has a mushroom flavor and it has kind of a bitterness to it I think the bitterness is where the medicine is all right you need to go find Tony give him his medicine

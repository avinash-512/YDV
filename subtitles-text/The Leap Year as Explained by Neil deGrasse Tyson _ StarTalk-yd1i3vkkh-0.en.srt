leap years no they don't happen all the time but need to do presidential elections but people freak out when it was a presidential election year is rare no it's every four years chill out we on earth as we orbit the Sun we know how to calculate a year is how long it takes to come back to where you were that's a year but it turns out if you cut the number of days we live in to the year it doesn't divide evenly so there's not an even number of days in the time it takes earth to go around the Sun it takes like three hundred sixty five and a quarter days to go around the Sun so we just ignore that quarter day just sweep it under the rug for three years the fourth year how many quarters have you added up four so there's a whole day now that you saved up and in the fourth year you put that day back in the calendar and you give it to the neediest month februari and so this is the origin of the leap day and this is as it was conceived in the julian calendar the calendar that preceded the current calendar of the gregorian most people don't know that this one every four year rule over correct the weekday it's not actually threw in a 65 and a quarter day  it's a little bit less than a quarter so you wait four years and put in a whole day that you put in too much so you have to wait until you put in a whole day too much then you take out elite day that would have otherwise appeared so every hundred years you have over corrected by a leak day by an entire day so every hundred years hundred years are divisible by four aren't they every hundred years you take out the lead day that would have otherwise been there so 1900 was not a leap year 1800 was not a leap year 1700 was not only . for this reason ok so now by taking out that day now you have over corrected in the opposite direction and now there's a day that you have to put back in it turns out every 400 years so every 400 years in the century year that would have not had a leap day on the century rule gets a leap day put back in on the 400 year rule this sounds complicated but it has profound implications in the year 2000 it's a century year that wouldn't normally get a leap day but it says century year divisible by 400 we put the leap so when everyone experienced the leap day in the year 2000 you're saying to herself of course it's a leap year it's it's like no it's a leap year because it's a century year divisible by 400 therein is the gregorian calendar as it was established in 1582 that's the story of the calendar you asked ok I was sitting here minding my own business and you have to ask about the calendar and the leap yeah

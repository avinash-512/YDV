Bear vs. Gorilla  Fan Questions _ StarTalk yeah yeah I generally there are exceptions to this but generally in nature the higher mass animal wins and this case it would be the grizzly bear which far outweighs the gorilla when I far maybe x factor of a few the more mass you have generally the stronger you are and no matter what other tactics and tools you have there are exceptions to this animals with venom for example well that they're cheating really not actually fighting you down there sending chemicals into you to paralyze your heart and stop your heart and then they come after later and each you okay so yes there are exceptions in this that can change that the the balance of power but generally it's a mass thing and yeah I bet on the grizzly bear by far unless you give a 30 or 36 to the grill grille is have opposable thumbs

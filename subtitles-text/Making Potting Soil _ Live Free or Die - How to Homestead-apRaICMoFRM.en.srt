we're making some potting soil today and any good potting soil meets three criteria it retains moisture for a long time it drains well and it has enough fertility to get the plants off to a good start in life if you grow out a lot of potted plants every year like we do you you could wind up spending hundreds of dollars a year on on good potting soil it's good to learn how to make your own soil we're going to start this potting soil out with a bucket full of sand got to have saying your potting soil to make sure it drains well next what you want to do is you want to pile up a bunch of leaves or wood chips you let him rot down for a year or two and you strip off the top and you'll see some nice black stuff underneath this is a component of the mixture that's going to hold a lot of water the the sand and this this would be organic matter provides a nice Airy substrate for the plant to hang out in but it provides little fertility we got a secret ingredient that provides the fertility that this material is lacking all right on to the next step now time for the screen ingredient we take the rabbit poopies and shoveling over here into this bathtub and there's red worms in here and they eat up the rabbit poopies and then they poop out our fertilizer of choice warm castings worm castings are awesome really expensive to try to buy them catch you on the flipside bunny rabbits now we're going to mix up our potting soil right so we got the we got our sand we got our writing down wood chips and we got the worm there's a whole web of symbiotic relationships taking place in the soil thus and enhances the potting soils ability to drink this is a sponge essentially so this holds moisture in the potting soil mixture this has all of the nutrients that that a plant needs to get get a good start in life let's go ahead and shift these materials so that they're more manageable as you can see this mixture is becoming coarser and coarser longer I'm sitting it and that's because the nice fine stuff is slipping through this sieve and i'm just going to kick this step off to the side and let the chickens and tea plants have and there's a nice sifted stuff that you can see now let's dump in our worm casting all right I think we got this pretty well accept it check this aside throwing our once we have this all mixed up we'll just pack this away into buckets under the house and busted that when we're ready to plant some trees

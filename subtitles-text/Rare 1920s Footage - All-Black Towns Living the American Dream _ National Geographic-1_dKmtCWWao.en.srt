in Oklahoma is the unique space in terms of the number of african-american towns that were established some suggest upwards of fifty African American towns between 1924 1928 Reverend as joan was going around documenting this sort of self-determine vibrant african-american communities you see the african-american educators doctors lawyers land owners oil barons and I think that's what's so remarkable about this footage to think that individuals how many years out of slavery are now owning oil wells that are producing 2,000 barrels a day is that not the ultimate American Dream is that not the ultimate American story if flies in the face of what I think some people considered part of african-american history and culture and I think that that was one of the things that Oklahoma and what s jones is really kind of showing is that that african-american history and culture is not a monolith and in a way it became kind of like a marketing tool to encourage individuals to migrate to move there that this is a place where you can live you can thrive and peacefully reside there were still palpable racial tensions there are lynchings there's Jim Crow segregation there's all of these things and you still have an african-american community are many communities that really speak to the fortitude of resilience of black people in this country

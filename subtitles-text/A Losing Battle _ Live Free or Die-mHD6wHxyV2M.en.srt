yeah well the waters dropped quite a bit it just means that i don't have any water to drink right now so i'll have to try to dig it deeper starting to get a little bit of water pooling up which i would expect but kind of at the limit of what i can do by hand here it's been almost two months since desert Nomad Tobias first arrived in this Arizona canyon each passing days test of his survival know how I don't think I can keep digging like this much longer this trip is a lot about challenging myself and trying to see if I am capable of doing what I think i should be able to do as a human which is go out onto the earth and provide for myself my whole life I've been trying to figure out how to live out here and hopefully I can stay within my limits and still do this intensive during it's probably going to be enough to where I can get a little water tonight but at the rate that the water is dropping I'm not going to be able to keep getting water out of here reliably I pretty much have realized that the well is not going to provide me water much it's just kind of a losing battle

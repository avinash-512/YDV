no real talk okay you just saw the new episode of wicked tuna now it's time for wicked tuna real talk with captain's weigh in on their week of fishing i'm your host my name is mike sulka joining us this time captain Tyler McLaughlin of the pinwheel captain TJ out of Hot Tuna and captain Dave Marciano of the hard merchandise guys thanks for joining us in the last episode only two weeks of fishing left here the pressure is on to land the final paychecks before the season closes it all comes down to whether the tuna are at the right spot you choose to fish and at this point in the game decisions need to pay off so for Tyler plots bank came up empty this week had a big decision to make about where to go let's take a look what we're doing here i have no idea like nothing here kinda like the spot like we are only anything about this you don't I your piss-poor attitude i know but if they're not anal about where you are don't touching it could be a whole day behind the fleet up because it was one moon do i want to add here badly staying here is a complete waste of time but Stephen around is going to cost me more money and fuel so I need to make sure that i picked the right spot either way I'm taking a chance but I think I know what we're gonna do no tuna here jr. we've got to go to fippennies to pull it up to 15 each we get all of this spot with all the ways you want to god i really like this business plan i really do argue that's her anger and get out here all right Tyler start of the week so you're gonna go to platts and you made the decision pretty quick that wasn't gonna work out headed to fippennies instead how'd you make the decision what went into it you know it's been my honey hole all year it's been productive for me but life was gone the whales were going on the bait was gone and we needed a change how can you tell because you don't want to be chasing the the fish around how do you tell the hey this is dead vs this is gonna live it up pretty soon you know we're fishing every day we kind of get the pattern down and get the routine when the fish wanna roll through and there was nothing going on there and it was best we got out of there when i looked around I didn't see a single vote for miles i do i posted in the wrong spot day there you are you're out on fippennies you're just doing your thing there's nobody around for miles and all the sudden here comes Tyler steaming on in let's take a look at either right here he's the one playing follow-the-leader Leda who is a yeah maybe you can't blame the kid look at it to get got fish the way we were catching fish I debate John going to find him this season may come down to him and I do get out at the last day of the season just like an old-school boxing match with Marciano you know the story there right Rocky Marciano the undefeated Jeff to be defeated a few years hey I want you to stand by the committee shirts that pull it out of me a bit here I don't think that one kid but I hope we get to me I did happen Tyler here definitely puts the pressure on but Jay and I can handle it we've been handling it all season you're out their fifties is not a boat around for miles and kind of a bunch of fish that we got lucky we follow the fish on fippennies and for a few days we had it to ourselves and that's the game really out there you know you hope to keep it as long as you kid to yourself you didn't seem too concerned but when Tyler show I mean you're the one in the lead and that's what I gotta feel it different for you yeah i know we're happy with that and you don't believe that's not my primary focus but you know what we were on a roll we're catchin fish will take it when it comes it's all tell your kind of back in this again right into that big fish towards the end really get yourself back into the competition was a couple years ago that you were leaving this thing and ended up winning it how does it feel to be back in the middle and the hunt of it you know Travis and we lost David's we've been having a tough go just meet him getting working but we're catching fish together we get we're starting at confidence and it just about us being on top of fish this fish under the boat we're going to get them and that's what's gonna come down at the end our wall pinwheel hard merchandise . com Kellyanne all caught fish this week which is a good thing things did not go so well for hot too and the guys fish round-the-clock had a couple of hookups but unfortunately lost both fish so let's check it out I'm pretty confident that me and Mike get the job done oh god there is 20 feet walk the nice one that's in this field and look up to that I hope so Michael walking back walking Oh their got-damned I don't like waking up in the middle of the night to lose a fish now we gotta start all over again get back on anchor rebate regroup so right now the stocks my teacher I like seeing you guys at night that's a different a different look for the Hot Tuna but we like to snuggle with each other down here and you get our beauty rest yeah we eat a lot of family meeting lots of you really you really pretty close you guys snuggling together at night yeah Arriba oh yeah that's right about something that all yeah what uh what are the extra challenges but dogs decide what efficient at night arm someone's always gonna be awake you know a lot of times were fishing in areas that are you know I a lot of like traders and stuff like that and big draggers so that someone's going to pay attention to the salary of the fish are coming through there's bait you know means it's it's it's it's two jobs instead of just one really you think you think that the fact that it was night did that did that factor in it also tell the buckle now now I mean like Jack was right on the bite and and I mean it happens when we have really pulled hooks all year so we're just like a little bit of a rut right now more soon you've been doing this a long long time I don't mean that you know what to say you're right maybe even your own right you look like you're doing pretty well they share be done a lot of night fishing yeah we do with you know we all try to but again the issue of my boat is it's just J&I so we do reach the point where you know we step as much as we can but at sublight we say you know what let's bring the rods in so we can get a couple hours you know a good sleep we put the radar reliable and I'll sleep in the captain's chair and you know at some point we gotta quit that's the benefit though when you get a boat like TJ's get the extra guys you could try to keep somebody up all night you know keep one guy up two guys sleep and you get a few fish to of that though it's definitely beneficial most of what we catch probably eighty percent guys right is daytime vision but if there are fish around you can get some bites at night so it is worth doing well it's sort of interesting for both you day me and for you tell you both started off the season with three on your boat and end up now with two when you look at TJ with 4 on that boat no excuses yeah yeah we will have our jobs you know Michaels like a cook but it's dad's there you go yelling everything going on with you ya know getting benefits we share me hate appreciate why the question becomes how do you guys feel as if my teachers got a pretty big edge on you and Saul you do with two does it does it add up definitely doesn't mean he's got a huge advantage over us you know yeah we're all that great trip yeah huge very well we saw you pull the hook there right i mean and not just the first one but the second the second seemed like it was going to be a really big fish you really only have one week left to go that the boats a fourth-place you feel like that one may have cost you a shot at the title I mean that was definitely a bigger fish that first hook Pole was kind of quick and it was definitely you know we suspect how big it was but the second was a nice fish and you know we definitely better put up or shut up because it's coming down to the end this week we saw pinwheel and fishing vessel tuna.com each catch-and-release bluefin that were smaller than the 73-inch limit the guys on comm actually put a tag on their short before releasing it look like this don't come around I can't see them going to the don't let it go i love the play do something go boom you're a little guy that's tagged him Sondra gets this fish the boat and we can see it's way too small and I think below 73 inches we let go and that's all about sustainability we did a good deed of the very awarded get the tags already going to go pull the middle tag sometimes when we released fish we tagged it will help researchers know the growth rate of the fish and where they were released and where they migrated to a lot of information can be a team from tagging a tunafish the real journalism already tagged fish there's no question there's more shorts right now and there was in the beginning year I know the fish are biting it's close to the end of the season we're gonna keep going until we're back on top of the fleet alright that's what you let's go to get others to give ya guys we saw Dave . com they're actually hook up and gets a short decides to tag it more so you've been doing this a long time when do you decide to tag one when we do make that call ok it's a short usually we if we have some tags will check the fish lock the location the size of fish estimated size what time we caught it and catch it release it and that all goes into building in the sustainability of the resource the more information we can gather the better fishery managers managers and scientists will be able to help us as fishermen you know help rebuild that resource because you know without a doubt fishermen these days and it's been like that for a lot of years definitely want to be part of the solution not by the problem at some point are you gonna reap the benefit of the information not just in terms of sustaining the fishery but also figuring out where they are at all times exactly you know we we would we find out the boy work we do with tagging the more information we find out about their habits their behavior stuff that we used to guess at what now Doo tagging you know the scientists can kinda prove what we think are our theory sometimes teach you how important is the responsibility factor hear me now how active are all the fishermen in making sure that was you follow it's huge I mean the United States we have such strict rules that we abide by and and we're actually sustainable fishery where there's other countries foreign countries that just kill everything you know I mean like they said it is crucial information that we get from these people to you know figure out these fish their patterns and then we can use that to benefit us in the future try and catch them I'm sure it's pretty frustrating Tyler you catch a fish and then you gotta throw the thing back it's not you've been fighting the thing even for a little while but just give you a sense of hope of okay well that's another fish that's gonna be around long term for me to catch down the road you know that I grew up tag and fish and my dad and something always did it was like a fun thing to do and try and see if you know where your fish was going to go with its growth rate was going to be but for me it's like at least you're getting bites at least the fish are interested in what you're putting out and soon enough a big ones going to come by our it's been a long time I'm coming but yes the Kellyanne finally caught their fifth fish of the season after what a four-week drought let's take a look at that Ben rod a little bigger than we thought you got a good look at him now yeah I think he's there I want to take a look we haven't caught a fish in three weeks we have got all in the spin the game I go forward but John's help the wheel no truck just the gap get the gap gap shredding gonna get together gonna get a tear of tell me why did you do that go yeah right . he's good-looking fish I nice color we are so stopped slob pay their beta it's I think it's a good son hopefully we can keep it going we're not going out for martinis with commercial fishing for a paycheck because I families need money that's what we do 1230 yeah right let's go get his brother and his sister yeah guys Paula and has it all a little bit with that boat this year as we know now there's a rumor and a legend that he's one of the great bluefin fishermen of the northeast of Gloucester your dream it is he really just asking tell you that it's really showing you have aspired to be a captain so many so i think i know where you're going with the answer but I how legitimate is the legend Dave no wait look it is legitimate his family has a long history catching bluefin Judah and what policy experience is what we've all experienced you know we could all say it right you know some years you can do nothing wrong in some years you can do nothing right and I think we've all been there yeah it was my right is definitely the hydrogen this year now be honest it is crew it's not as crews fault right now you know it's his decision where they go into the serum wheel makes the call and if what i see his crew is definitely right there backing him up and he's not really giving them the support they need I'll tell you brought it up I mean there's a difference between Paul the captain and Paul the mate what is that difference we know polynomial fishing me he worked in the square into the boat and he's great you know hooking fish reeling them in harpooning them all that aspect when you put the steering wheel in his hand and he asked him to go find some tunas I think he's a little bit out to lunch what about the leadership element is it something you've dealt with i know this year is trying to learn how to be a leader on the boat for me I tried to mold Travis this year and for me it's all about just I do my job and he does his job and everything will be ok it seems like Paul is trying to do too much you know he's trying to like catch too many tunes we can you just focus on catching one fish and start their get the crew to come together get everyone on the boat of the same page and then maybe you'll get hot and catching fish TJ you had some of the same I mean you guys have had some different roles on your boat your dad or the late so you know as some guys can handle the pressure some guys can and nothing against Paul I think he's a great fisherman a great asset to a boat but it does not look like he can handle the there's no doubt about I mean it's not as crews fault you know it's his decision to put these guys on fish and it's their job to work when the rod bends they can only do so much with that rod doesn't been ok if not a lot of doubt on your boat about who the captain's well yeah yeah and it you know i think part of the field ball to right is that's part of the learning curve because being the captain you know doesn't make you God right you have a leader you call the shots but you still need the team to work with you know that's essential and I think you know Paul struggling without a little bit you know what I mean just try to you know that leadership we are ok we gotta do this together but still with the same . there is one guy who makes the calls and who's responsible for DJ question a lot of your decisions i haven't seen a lot of you may actually think that's what you guys want we have long and you really want to toss go but sometimes real simple but alright there's one week left until the end of the season it really does seem like anyone in the top for the hard merchandise fishing vessel tuna.com pinwheel or hot too and are all in it they all of the chance of coming out on top so guys let's start with you Tyler what are you gonna do in these final this final week the final few days efficient to make sure that your boat comes out on top I'm gonna do everything that paul hasn't been doing and I'm gonna keep putting fish on the deck of the boat tjw I'm gonna pray the tuna God's very very heavily that's what honking it was a prayer start with 0 tuna gods divided sky the wind blows you look out for the tuna guys on ya down so I know they're up they're always on there nothing but a flock of birds above you need something and then finally Dave you're in the lead this is it this is you're in a different spot you've got to protect so how how does your game plan different change the LM not really much you again we got here just by doing what we do best just keep ridin just keep going and hopefully a lock holds out you know some some guys say there's no such thing is like I'll be the first to admit yes you need skill you need a good crew that's crucial but at some point luck plays a factor Dave on the.com you don't think there's any luck involved at all he'll even tell you no such thing is like I think that's a bunch of we write a little bit of luck is what got us to where we're at and I'll be the first to it first to admit I'd rather be lucky than good any day the we need to do they have a prevent defense and fishing there's no prevent is there is no way also to make sure you sit on this no you look I'll do the best hey kid we'll keep grinding but you know ultimately my goal is to catch as many as i can whether it's the first you know the most of the fleet of the last of the fleet as long as we've done is best weekend for the year that's what makes me happy alright that's gonna do it

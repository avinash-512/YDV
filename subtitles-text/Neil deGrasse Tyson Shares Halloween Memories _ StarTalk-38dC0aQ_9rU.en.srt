I was never big into Halloween costumes when I was a child I had a costume but I didn't have so much invested in what it was what it looked like that became a part of my childhood memories I grew up my formative years were in a huge apartment building 22 stories told 21 apartments per floor and there were three of these buildings there were thousands of people in this community it's apartment door right after apartment door separated by twenty feet so we would go trick-or-treating and feel an entire shopping bag of candy take it home take on another bag and continue this and I pitied children who lived in the suburbs would have to like walk down the sidewalk grow up the walkway knock on the door wait for them to answer get a few pieces of candy say thank you back to the sidewalk and continue this message was poor children they don't get any candy at all what was like the best candy that you get I liked the course you know I mean I've been at this for a while Milky Way To Mars Bar good with that stupid question of course that's what I like

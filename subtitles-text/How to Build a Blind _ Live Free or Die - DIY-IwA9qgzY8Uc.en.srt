when I talk to people about seeing all kinds of wildlife they're always amazed and they say they go into four star Parker wooded area to take pictures of wildlife and birds and then we'll see anything so come along and I'll show you how to build your own natural blind for free well this looks like a good spot let me check it out have broken up my outline that's good it's in his shadow that's really good all i need to do is kind of remodel it i'm gonna go break some vegetation and some death sticks and kind of give me a little bit more shadow what I'm doing out here in the forest is the same thing you might do in your garden when you just proved you're shrubbery a little bit of trouble like this they get print all the time by storms and win branches falling out of trees they simply regrow their greenery so I'm going to basically plant some shrubbery kind of an irregular pattern just like nature this will kind of camouflage my movement I don't really want this to be a wall of obstacles i wanted to be kind of spread out so you can actually see through it but it just kind of defers your eye when you glance at it and creates more shadow i'm gonna look at this from the animals perspective and see what they see it needs a little bit more camouflage i'm going to go from the inside now and dress up the inside of my little blind what I'm looking for is when i'm sitting back here if I hear noise that way over here sound of an animal their own footprint our I want to be able to move around a little bit and turn my head without catching the animals I in the smallest movement of these lease is natural in the forest so they're going to see that instead of seeing my ears are my ice movement and I've got my blind bill got my body camouflaged calm down i'm just going to sit and wait for the animals to come

I've been active in social media but just cuz it is it'll be fun for me I have these thoughts every day of my life I've always had them these is little snippets or one one region misconduct curiouser and I have these thoughts and they would I would have been in the battery no one would know about things me in a Twitter comes along and say hey I can place the thought in a tweet I got my hornet you known carpet so that it fits wrap with the five had but I got that and I realize people were resonating with people liked it and they've read measure that by do they reach we did who've been cared about me to you that they're not wasting your their friends time on what anything I would have said but people would reach with you and then this was my evidence that there was a underserved underbelly curiosity that perhaps works with a missile maybe it's there from Charlton we're all curious breast that flames childhood is now just diminish to a world glowing ember just have to panic and bring it back to I I think I I can do that in a few cases are there others where it is completely extinguish a little harder after reignited but at least there is something there left over from childhood I find that practically everyone has a in as a curiosity about the natural world so I think social media can be especially potent as a vessel vehicle for delivering not only information but stimulating people to become once again and there is Chris Hadfield singing a pop song in space he's liking it we all knew the song international your mind it may be that astronauts are people too he's one of us much the same things we like yes on the way we have fun maybe the future space is not that I've just the right stock maybe it's anyone board

you know they have been underestimated us all our lives it was a fairytale the two of them against the world she understood him and knew him and what he needed he was very private individual by all reports very shy so he had a a very good manner of dealing with people but there was always a space and I think Nancy fill that space for him when they were with each other they could be themselves especially nancy when she was not being watched when she was nothing was expected of her she could just be herself and that's hot that's in the scriptum know the film i hope that's where you'll see a kind of intimacy that you can only imagine ronald reagan never would have overcome his wound inflicted by john hinckley of heat if Nancy Reagan had not been there every step of the way he depended on Nancy Reagan after he was shot almost every psychologically emotionally and physically she didn't run the country she ran him and he needed that there's a moment in the movie where and this comes after the assassination attempt where Nancy goes to her husband and tries to convince him that she'd like to hire an astrologer to warn them when they're going to have bad days I had there's been mockery made of her as a result of that decision and the control that she sort of seized in the the object and determine protection of her husband which is all understandable i think what is so affecting in that scene both and how it's written and performed is you immediately can feel the underlying love that is motivating all of this when she sits on ronald reagan's lap and she looks some deeply the i begs us of them you can see concern on the gravely wounded Ronald way in space and and in his eyes that concern comes from a love for his wife and I think it's a rather beautiful scene i think they were as close as two people could be the strength of the bond was undeniable you know Nancy says all these things about Ronnie you know when she met him that's when her life began that she didn't really feel that her life had begun before that her career was to help him in every way he could to make his make his dreams come true

when I was a kid I loved the idea of finding a new planet way away from the Sun you know we might have just like bound one right hey guys Amy and trace with you on dnews today the biggest news in the world no bigger ok the biggest news in the solar system is that researchers from the california institute of technology might have found a new planet currently known as planet 9 this new discovery could be hugely significant planet 9 has about 10 times the mass of earth and is probably close in size to Neptune on top of that it is so far away this giant planet orbits roughly 2.8 billion miles from the Sun making its year last between ten and twenty thousand earth years Amy this planet is bonkers and before you ask it is definitely a planet according to the international astronomical union definition a planet needs to orbit the Sun Jack be massive enough to be around double check and have enough gravitational pull to clear its orbit triple check in fact between its size and distance from the Sun planet 9 dominates an area larger than any other giant planet we know this is so cool except now full disclosure we haven't actually seen planet 9 yeah true for the moment this new planet is theoretical which raises a very interesting question if this planet has been in our own solar system this whole time why are we only finding it now well because we weren't looking for it this was kind of an accident in 1992 astronomers at the University of Hawaii discovered this small object orbiting out past the dwarf planet pluto at least 40 times the distance from Earth to the Sun since then astronomers have been scanning this region called the Kuiper belt and reporting on their findings during these scans a research team at Caltech notice that six of the 13 most distant known Kuiper belt objects clumped together in strange way the objects all travel at different rates but they all have similarly elliptical orbits tilted from our own another pair of researchers tried to figure out what was causing these small bodies to behave so strangely but also similarly by mapping the gravity in orbit of all the known objects they determined there's just not enough mass in that part of the Kuiper belt to affect them like this the Kuiper belt would need to be more than 100 times more massive to be the culprit so what else could be causing this weird behavior a massive planet by trying different arrangements using computer simulations the researchers determined the only thing that could cause that gravitational effect would be a massive planet way out in the Kuiper belt this is how they found a planet 9 this might sound like a lot of sketchy guesswork but it's actually a viable method of finding planets that has worked in the early eighteen hundreds astronomers tracking the newly discovered planet Uranus notice that it didn't follow the orbit mathematical model said it should the only explanation was that some other planet without they're tugging on Uranus so they use Newtonian laws to mathematically predict where and what that object should be and lo and behold they found that Thun orbiting roughly where the mystery object was predicted once astronomers had mathematical models showing where to look for Neptune it was pretty easy to spot it I mean considering the scale of the solar system neptune is not that far away for a powerful telescope planet 9 on the other hand is not only really far away astronomers don't totally know where to look for it just yet as researchers continue to refine their simulations to learn more about planet nines orbit and influence on the distant solar system and in the meantime astronomers are going to start sky hunting if the planet is at its closest point to the Sun right now it should be visible in images gathered during previous surveys but if it's at its farthest from the Sun it might still be visible though we need the world's largest telescopes to spot it if it's there and according to the math it probably is planet 9 could change the understanding of our if you want to explore more Spacey things with me check out my own channel vintage space where I dig into all kinds of things related to early space exploration in the early 1960s NASA didn't look into building a doughnut-shaped inflatable space station but it never got off the ground in large part because the agency with laser focused on getting a man to the moon by the end of the nineteen sixties Amy what do you think we're going to name this planet like we do Roman stuff so planet Baucus and go somewhere else like plenty doesn't weigh be planet trace I like that that sounds good we do that what would you guys name it let us know down in the comments make sure you subscribe for more dnews and also subscribe to his channel and thanks for watching

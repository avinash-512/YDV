damn it well I really got to get this roof repaired the wet snow is just way too much for the canvas god damn it this building is over 20-some odd years old that me and my brother built when I was 20 21 and it's lasted a long time but it needs a lot of work I'm gonna have to take off all this plywood and put up some new rafters I'm gonna have to go out and cut me some lodgepole pine or else I won't have a job good age dry lodgepole pine is a very durable material and I have to get about 12 of them in order to have a good roof system i utilize a lot of this area to build whatever I need my house comes from the forest the blacksmith shop is one of my priorities because blacksmithing is my number one source of income and it's very important that I get that done so I can get back to work now I need my mules to pull these lodgepoles up out of the forest

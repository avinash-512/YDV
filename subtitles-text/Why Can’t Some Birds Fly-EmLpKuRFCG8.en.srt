imagine you could fly now imagine giving that up why would you ever do that hi guys Lissette here for dnews ostriches and emus Kiwis penguins one thing all these words have in common is that they can't fly an online bird feels like an oxymoron but maybe the most surprising thing about these creatures is that they all once flew they all evolved not to fly at one point signs of thought that maybe some of the birds living today evolved from flightless ancestors more specifically they thought this about the ratites a diverse group of large flightless avians which includes ostriches emus and Louis this hasn't been proven wrong thanks to DNA studies we now know that all of today's flightless birds came from ancestors that flew but they all independently evolved to lose their ability to fly and they did this all around the world penguins in Antarctica steamer ducks in South America emus in Australia Kiwis in New Zealand and ostriches in Africa it's astounding to think that given such different environments all these very bird populations would go through the same type of evolution or convergent evolution to be exact but why would the evolution of flight loss happen over and over again well two possible explanations largely influenced by Darwinian Theory are that changes in the environment either decrease pressure for flying or increased pressure to develop another trait this means that nature slowly selected for certain traits over others and along the way took away some birds ability to fly to illustrate how increased environmental pressures for traits other than flying work in practice let's dive into the biomechanical explanation in a study published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences research study different types of flying and wing propelled diving sea birds by analyzing energy costs and morphology they found that as a bird's functional ability to be a good diver increases its ability to fly decreases eventually to a point where flying ceases to be possible a larger body and short wings may help seabirds dive and swim better and thereby help them get more food for example but this body type makes taking off more difficult in other words penguins may have lost their ability to fly because involving to be better swimmers provided a greater advantage than flying and the two abilities required a trade-off you can't be both a great flier and swimmer so the environment puts pressure on birds to evolve certain abilities at the expense of others but a lack of environmental pressures can also lead to change if the environment doesn't strongly require bird to fly the bird may lose this ability over time for example in a study published in the journal evolution researchers argue that steamer ducks eventually lost their ability to fly in part because their South American coastal environment is suitable to live in year-round the birds didn't have a need to migrate and thus had little selective pressure to fly another example of diminished selective pressures is when the dinosaurs went extinct during this period birds were left without predators so without the need to fly away from hungry t-rex's the birds evolved other qualities the ostrich for example became huge and better suited for running rather than flying this lack of predation in the environment helps explain why so many flightless birds are found on islands that were isolated for extended periods of time why use of energy to fly when you can just strut around now these changes happen slowly over time through natural selection but I'd be remiss if I didn't also mention that you and I and all humans are also making birds flightless and very quickly through artificial selection our turkeys and chickens would look very different if we were breeding them to be large and needy for our consumption so big that they can no longer fly like their ancestors once did still while we certainly have a hand in their flight lessness today's flightless birds have naturally evolved to be this way which in some cases might be good because could you imagine how terrifying a flying ostrich would be on a kinda related note evolutionary change doesn't just affect living creatures it also affects the technology we use every day to find out how much dating technology has evolved since before the internet check out this video from our friends over at seeker stories Stephen sherry met back in nineteen seven he threw a video dating service called great expectations they've been married for 37 years I happened to see over the shoulder of some guy was watching that videotape this really pretty girl and she was the right age right everything what raid would you be thrilled to evolve or evolved out of let us know in the comments below and remember to subscribe so you never miss an episode of dnews thanks guys

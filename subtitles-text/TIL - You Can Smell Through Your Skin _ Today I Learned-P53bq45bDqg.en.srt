your noses in the only thing that can smell things you can smell through your skin and that was a big surprise in one of our expeditions I dive into a lot of these underwater caves that we call blue holes and maybe about 30 feet you hit my fees wild-looking colors that's actually the pigment in the cells of individual bacteria and you start smelling something well you're smelling hydrogen sulfide gas and it's that same rotten egg smell that you get out of sulphur springs that in high concentrations is extremely toxic you have a regulator your mouth you're wearing a mask so it's not coming in your nose you're not breathing it in yet and it's actually going through the pores in your skin the end up spending enough time in it you stop smelling it actually get into the olfactory knows and that's a sign we used to ourselves that we been in it too long get through it or come up these animals live in our buildings they go on our roots they even go into the sewer system get away from traffic and people and can move for considerable distances using those

i'm going to show you how to make cordage really simple cordage is definitely one of the skills that leads a person further into creating other primitive artifacts what I have here is tulip poplar inner bark and that's a tree that grows from all over the Blue Ridge looks pretty good I've got enough fiber here I can really quickly go and grab the fibers pull those out and get them all individually pulled apart portage is basically a natural fiber that has been wrapped onto itself in two contrasting twist that lock together one set of fiber is going one direction the other set of fiber is going the other direction so this is this cordage 101

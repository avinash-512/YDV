Building Shelter _ How to Survive on Mars what we get tomorrow as we need to solve our basic needs in particular protection from radiation first crew that lands on Mars will live in their ship but you can't live there very long the cosmic radiation and the solar radiation is going to penetrate the ship you have to get underground quickly we now know there are certain regions on Mars that have an extensive underground network of lava tubes this is where volcanoes have existed for hundreds of millions of years and as they died away they actually become huge rooms when we think about that in terms of human exploration they could be an attractive place to consider they provide a structure that is radiation for your in the huge underground cavern you still have to have their tight holes and stuff like that is all I get all hold the air in it but it'll protect you from radiation and it also protect you from temperature extremes the trick is lava tubes are not so easy to find because the underground we're still in the process of figuring out where those are mapping them is not a trivial thing now we also want to create some other kinds of living spaces outside of the lap tubes for instance we want to have inflatable transparent don't slip by natural sunlight and we can grow plants from my perspective before any humans get to the surface of Mars we were going to have sent in advance habitation radiation shelters you won't use an astronaut to do something is quote/unquote menial as billed habitant final precursors will be an army of robots and they'll begin to build the habitats I think about the technology we're developing today in 3d printed imagine being able to send a 3d printer the Martian surface that pulls the soil out add some water add some binder and is sitting there 3d printing shelters and you've got your homes rebuilt waiting for you right there now until such time in the rather distant future that Mars terraformed mars will have a theme atmosphere and so these things will have to be pressurized and as a result they can't be that big they won't be miles in diameter like the dome juicy and science fiction but don't 50 meters a hundred meters in diameter these are entirely possible we will have to live in dome cities and wearing spacesuits on Norris for a long time but that's not to say that we can't have a really nice life but it's not gonna be an earth life is going to be Mars life

the thing that really drives me the most is exploratory kayaking paddling down these rivers that have never been paddled before our goal here is the paddle the headwaters canyon of the Chena River this one run section and what is the tuner sure ok yeah so the headwaters canyon of the chicken river is really a new canyon 10 years ago was covered in ice and now because of the glacial retreat of the logan glacier we're now able to access it basically the only little landing strip that we could find was this a hundred yard long gravel bar so one of the time we had to strap our kayaks to the bottom of this small Bush blame and then our pilot shuttled us up there one at a time so of the course of the run run 12 mile canyon we really didn't know exactly how much will be porgy but there's a couple Rapids reportage they were really pretty pretty scary and you know if we were to make a mistake on either one of those it could have been fatal being on an expedition of this caliber can be kind of high stress but when you're out there with a bunch of your close friends who are all in their twenties it's pretty exciting and we keep it pretty lively I've never been anywhere that felt nearly as remote as the headwaters can with the chicken no human influence at all I love paddling around on classic rivers that have been run hundreds and thousands of times but what's most unique to me as a professional kayaker is when i get in the middle of nowhere that no one has ever been before and it just makes you feel really alive I guess some people really do not understand it and not like why here why are you doing this can't you just do something else of your life

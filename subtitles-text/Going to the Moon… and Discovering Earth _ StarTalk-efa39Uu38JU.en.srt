so we try to one of the drivers that created this change of awareness because no one really does that with without feeling guilt even if you did throw things out the window with disregard factor some interesting scenes and madmen which of course takes place in the sixties you just see them doing things what did we do that people walk into an elevator smoking a cigarette did we do that they finished a picnic and they toss everything on the ground did we do that so why did all this change what happened in the late sixties and go to 1968 the most turbulent year of a turbulent decade assassinations the Tet Offensive the anti-war movement and in that year this photo was published yes earthrise Apollo 8 they went to the moon orbited a dozen 15 times and then came back snapped this picture this was published in 1968 and we see earth as nature intended us to view it like with oceans and land and clouds we go to the moon to explore the moon and we discover earth for the first time and I looked at what happened after this photo was taken in the four years that we were going to the moon 68 69 70 71 and in 272 five years excuse me end of 68 in 272 that's when all this happened when was the environmental protection agency founded seventeen nineteen seventy okay when was first founded seventeen nineteen seventy when we were going to the moon that we had other issues in 1970 right assassinations and and unrest on college campuses and all the sudden people started thinking about earth earth right 1972 the catalytic converter is introduced that related gases banned DDT is banned 1973 around all these early years of the decade the comprehensive Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act always in that . so I'm thinking we go to space as well we go into space this is one of the really cool thing about that image it was internet you know how the NASA missions are so scripted they you know they played out yeah that was unanticipated and when you listen to the the dialogue that took place it was hate get the camera quick no one had actually said hey we're gonna come around the back side of the Moon and see there that even think and I think that the idea that that that that appreciation that the narrative power of that actually was more important than the mission part of of it

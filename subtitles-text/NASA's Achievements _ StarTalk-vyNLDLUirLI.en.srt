what what do you what do you want the future of space if you want what i really want the guys really want to what I want to know if there's life on Mars I think that's the single most important question in all of science right now not just biology not just astrophysics and allow me to broaden that to say you we want to know if this life anywhere other than Earth of course yeah but the place to go to answer the question butterly definitively is Mars at least we can get a confirmed sure yes or no in much less than 20 years and we don't need to send astronauts this can be done order pursuant automatically I want to know what the dark energy is and i want to know what the dark matter is because future of science but i'm talking about going places in space if we're going to explore the solar system Europa Ganymede and Callisto or obvious places wrong and how you make nice to see water of the Earth Moon and more than that and what's the fishing like there if you get our your eid ins and running around under the ice I have one of the headmaster III Charlie you said Charlie I said Charlie what are NASA's greatest accomplishments and what do you see for the future of this always find out why I feel so good about this agency today is because I honestly have you because you're running it by the native creatures are ya but we do something something something there's something we don't do as well as we should do okay you're watching you're going to my watching but in terms of technological achievement nobody can match us in terms of an inch achievement and exploration we are on Mars we are on the moon you know when Voyager left the solar system pageonce rom for the first time in the history of humanity not only had we visited every single planet in the solar system with some NASA instrument but for the first time in the history of humanity we had a man-made vehicle that had left our solar system that's a big deal Charlie I don't care what else your agency's doing when are you gonna give us the flying cars come on where we the one of those for me are trying to enable industry to do that and we're already collaborating with with companies i won't give him any adverse minister on autonomous automobiles whether they're going to fly or not I don't know but we're learning where we're collaborating with them because what they're learning about autonomous vehicles we're trying to apply to autonomous flight of unmanned aerial systems you know how do we make airplanes more efficient so there's a lot of collaboration going on so i won't be NASA that brings us flying cars but industry hopefully one of these days may develop it as a result of the collaboration with us okay so stop writing you letters about no no don't stop writing me letters I mean it's important that's the way we determine what what what the public wants and start with the hoverboard maybe the hard work would blow up except that for and move on

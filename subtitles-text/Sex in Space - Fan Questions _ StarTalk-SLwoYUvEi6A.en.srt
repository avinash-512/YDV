ok people when they think of space they typically imagine 0g where everything is floating but that's not a prerequisite for being in space if you have a rotating space station by way of the centrifugal force of the rotating wheel you can create any fraction of gravity you want even 1g which would be equivalent to earth right on that outer perimeter so if you could be in space and on that perimeter and 1g and it is no different than what you'd be doing here on earth at all but if you don't rotate up and you're sort of drifting towards your destination you are weightless and then everything is different if you're having sex in a weightless environment you need things like straps are probably some people who are fully equipped with this anyway but I'm just saying you begin to see the manifestations of Newton's laws of motion you're there floating in space and then you move towards someone and they just sort of bounced off and then you know the movement is sort of preserve there's no friction there's no so there you go so if you want to sort of get together stay together you need something like to keep you together during all the normal body movements that would characterize having sex in space so yeah just just bring a lot of leather belt to keep things strap tapping and you'll be just fine

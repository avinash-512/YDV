who are these people want to take one-way trips they don't like it here on earth are they the adventure types the people who want to die young what is who are these people I think that what we see first of all is that it's a it's everyone it's all kinds of people its men and women all the young its engineers of course scientists but also politicians lawyer soldiers it's all kinds of people and I think it's actually very comparable to the kinds of people that explored at the earth which could also have been anyone anyone could step on a ship and sail across the ocean anyone could decide to leave their village for new opportunities i was looking up some numbers back then 500 years ago in the great age of exploration most of the crew would not return alive you look at Magellan's crew how many he went out with and how many came back with alive I mean in some cases you lose most of your crew and that's just here on earth you can breathe the air and food was there waiting for you when you landed so many projections of survival rate the design of our mission is not detailed enough yet to give percentages but I i am certain that it's not going to be a safe mission to Mars because there's no such thing as a safe mission I think it will be more risky than climbing around Everest which is a two-and-a-half percent risk of not returning a life and hopefully less dangerous than climbing k2 which has a 25-percent exploration has always been dangerous and what's important for Mars one is that we identify the risks we make sure that everybody knows them not just our candidates which is 44 damage the most important but also our investors our media partners the audience and then if something doesn't go wrong just like with you below program people will understand that's this was something that could happen you know guaranteeing complete survival because that's inherent with being on the frontier of discovering all of our candidates know that this is a service commission and they know that they are going on a mission that's that has these kinds of dangers

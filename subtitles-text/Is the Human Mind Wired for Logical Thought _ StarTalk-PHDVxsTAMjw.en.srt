as we know Richard Dawkins is very outspoken about the religiosity in the world and atheism and he wants to convince people to think logically perhaps on the assumption that if you do then you won't think religiously perhaps I i don't know if it's that easy and when he dropped by my office i snared an interview with him for a star talk the first thing we discussed was the capacity of the human mind to think logically as check it does anyone subject that the most number of people say I was never good at insert a topic it's going to be math and so I say to myself if our brain were wired for logical thinking that math would be everyone's easiest subject and everything else will be harder so i have i'm kind of forced to conclude that our brain is not wired for logic many many people are extremely illogical but and the other way to configure along just fine life but i think is an interesting . the job and our wild ancestors needing to survive in the in the presence of lions and drought and famine and things you think logic would be pretty important to survive haha even if not mathematics that mean well it could be maybe early people who said oh there's a creature there with big teeth let me investigate first yeah i mean in a way that's right now and certainly little scientific is it is a bad thing curiosity doesn't always work and my eye I had a cousin as that was a little by put his finger in the limit in the mains and got a shock they did it again just to make sure you the real scientist but not very good for survival

so all these will is gonna be really nice just to make like a little bit of a jerky back you don't want too much bulk there was a jerk he needs to dry fast it's nearly 60 degrees in southern Utah at those temperatures meat will spoil in as little as two hours if that fails to get a supply preserve quickly to lose vital rations before he knows for sure the land still has all the resources he needs to survive you know I like to spend my jerk you acts up in the tree away from other animals that might be interested in eating it mountain lions that come through here a lot of times and there are raccoons as well so i'm going to try to stabilize a little bit more and these young shoots are still very moist and flexible so I can use those of binding a federal pull too tight so far I mean it looks good it feels really good to be back but i still have a lot to do to settle back into camp I didn't bring all the resources I need for this moment because i just got back here so just making do what I can this all i'm going to use for basically coating the meat it's going to help the jerky taste a little bit better and act as the observer tea now the jerky racks built in main thing at this point is just to hoist it up away from animals off the ground safe this week I brought it with me I'll give me going for a little while hopefully i can start finding other food

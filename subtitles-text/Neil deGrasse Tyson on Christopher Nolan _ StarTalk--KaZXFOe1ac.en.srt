I don't know if it was because of my tweets on the movie gravity I don't know if that put me on the radar of the people for the film interstellar but i was invited to a preview screening of that film with all the stars in the reception and Christopher Nolan was there and I then I sort of you know hello might you be interested in coming on for an interview and he agreed so that was my sort of access to him and i think i would also delighted interviewing anyone of the stars but Christopher Nolan is is one of the creators of that story end of the movie and so that would be a different interview then if I'd interview one of the actors and so I I'd like seeing what goes on in the mind of someone with futuristic creativity and christopher nolan is just such a person you look at his portfolio he's got movies that have played with the passage of time time passing at different rates in different dream states real or is it a dream in an interstellar he is exploiting the laws of physics as represented in Einstein's relativity theory to have time pass at different rates among people who are otherwise contemporaries with one another people who have children who relativity says that if you go in the vicinity of a black hole time ticks differently for you that for others he had a science advisor who's a professor of physics at Caltech so it was fun speaking with a creative producer because they have such influence on our dreams giving us ways to think about the world showing us futures that we should avoid should do all we can to not have the future he portrays in that field

I tend to take a cosmic perspective us let me pose the question differently there's this spec call earth sitting in the boy up space in orbit around and average stock your life forms on that speck call humans who are so sure that on that speck on the solutions to all their problems on that speck that the rest have this universe should be neglected until the day that all their problems are solved on that subject that so I view question we have energy problems down here the has limitless supply of energy where people fighting wars over resource the rock asteroids that have more gold on them then have ever been mined in the history of the world what is it you want to do people condemn I have a problem 0 solve the problem here as well exploration comes with dangers risks but above all else comes with rewards rewards have help well longevity you should never say explore here not there she never legislate what frontier gets breach next could you don't know what's on the other side either those frontiers you have no idea I don't have any idea a colleague of mine is an expert in studying atomic nuclei he found out that nuclei resonate with magnetic fields that are placed across that he won the Nobel Prize for that discovery later on a medical technologist says hey wait a minute that little nucleus with the resonance with the with their magnetic I could break a machine out of that and i cant identify certain Adams inside your body that are not good she a Kansas of tissue inside your body after that came magnetic resonance imaging the Mr don't ever tell me which direction frontier should research and presume that you know the answer that you want to have on the other side at Baruch the history of this exercise does not bear that out

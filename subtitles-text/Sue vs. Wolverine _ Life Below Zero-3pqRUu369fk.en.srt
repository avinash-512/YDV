there's a series of tracks here and this is a Wolverine how can I tell size of the track you know that's a big damn Wolverine Catholic means Wolverine an Eskimo the river was named because of the amount of wolverine on it only a porkchop goes after Wolverine with the 22 so what I think i'm going to do is I'll get home one grab the 30-30 and do the rest of the perimeter with a 30-30 I don't want to go plan for Armageddon but this is a little 3030 a little bit more band but I did see a really large Wolverine print more than one set so I'm going to feel more comfortable having a larger caliber rifle with going and finishing out more of the perimeter no rest for the weary was that the wicked

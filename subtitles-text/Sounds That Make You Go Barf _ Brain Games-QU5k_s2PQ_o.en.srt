I would love for you to give me your honest opinion about our new headphones would you like to try them out bring it let's go try this one on throw him on check it out picking up ok it's so clear excellent i'll be jamming on the subject like a nice at first our volunteers are picking up nothing but good vibrations love this song well fall well well and when you 20 you go ball ball ball ball yeah I can't do it what they don't realize is we are controlling what they hear from behind the set what do you think will happen if we mix in some unsavory sounds offering up a selection of noises ranging from the merely obnoxious to get me the heck out of here the nails that were coming down that was really weird because it was like the back of my mouth the t swear like now it's like a balloon today you love that one is the Spice Girls appears to my soul the styrofoam start to my back and it works its way up like this and then it comes up here then it's on my head I hate it yeah yeah I don't like that so it sounds like something nice for one up when I heard the barf I felt it in my body like right here in my stomach that may be so what's going on here why do we have such a physical reaction to nothing more than unpleasant noise  how does your brain sends sound and why does it respond so physically to some sounds but not to others measured in something called hurts sound waves move through the air as vibrations the higher the frequency the more powerful the vibrations the highly sensitive systems of your inner ear received these sound waves and sent information about them to your brain remarkably many sounds trigger your amygdala the part of your brain that controls the fight-or-flight response suggesting our brains have actually evolved to associate sounds of a certain frequency with danger or distress these sounds aren't language but they do communicate they are meant to trigger an immediate biological response so those shivers you feel probably tied to our ancient survival instinct

my years in Yosemite were the best years of my life that was where I was training and i was learning the skills of big wall climbing and I wanted to find walls and that people hadn't done before and I wanted to pioneer my own rounds but you know a conclusion that i did come to from going on all these expeditions climbing is kind of a selfish pursuits so I start thinking what can I do with this with the skills that I've built up as a climber and I come across this issue of national geographic buoys Venezuelans islands in time may I don't know how i found it i opened it up guess what there's giant rock towers in the Amazon jungle they're called to please I thought wow how do you get up one of those cliffs that looks awesome the article of course is not about that it's about science it's about the summit's of these mountains being the poem of like all these endemic species and they've evolved separately we're talking plants and animals from their cousins that live down in the jungle below everything up there is unique one of these unique creatures is called pebble toad there's a couple things about them that are really unique if you look at the the hind feet they are adapted for climbing in a way that's totally unique I think there's eight species of pebble toads five of them have been found on the top of two police and I'm thinking who ok i'm starting to get the beginning of an idea here the guy who's trying to figure this all out why do these creatures happened to exist on the summit of these two please dr. Bruce means this guy has been on 32 expeditions to the he's a biologist he's found tons of new species so Bruce and I come up with this plan and this plan is custom-made for National Geographic we say so have your people been up on the summit of this mountain and they're looking at it and they're like oh yeah our guys have been up there they go up a helicopter they found a lot of cool stuff like okay that's cool have you guys been down in the bottom in the jungle they're like oh yeah totally her guys have been all over the they found a lot of stuff down there like oh that's cool have you guys been here in the middle of the veg patch on the actual wall and they're all like they're like actually no I don't think our guys have been on the wall and that's when Bruce like slams his fist down on the table and says I guarantee that i will find new species on the to Polly the only problem is now we've told them that we're going to go up where the veges on the wall and as a climber that's really not the way you want to go you want to avoid the veg so we've got ourselves a little bit of a problem like most of these adventures the best part of it is connecting with the local people so here and there in the Amazon isn't Amerindians and we need these guys to help us to get into the base of the tower there's no possible way that we we could have found it we did not anticipate that the hardest part of this trip was going to be just getting to the you can see this Ridge right here this doesn't look that bad this looks like a ridge like in the shadow is right you hike up this thing that little section there which is half a mile took us five days and what you can't see is that it's actually really steep under there and it's jungle mountaineering and we would scrape our way up these little walls and then we build these little ladders would put ropes down and we put these rooms on so that we could all move up with our gear but eventually we came to this spot that we called the slime wall bona fide slime so like at this point we've climbed all kinds of different stuff like all different kinds of rock I say even climbed grass in poland in the Tatras which is another great story but I'd never climb slime the closest that i could I came was trying to climb the greased pole at the fryeburg fair in Maine but slime is really really really hard to climb we were relying on going up these vines we think the highest we got up the wall was like 10 feet and then defines would break off we'd slide down the wall and then hit this little ledge and you've had to hit the ledge because there's a huge drop-off right to decide the amerindian guys thought that this was probably the greatest show that they had ever seen in their life and eventually we're like hey you know what guess what dude you're giving this pitch ago Edward Edward was like he didn't speak English but he kind of got the message he was all like what I'm leaving it there like added here's the harness and we suited him up well guess what the Amerindians like these guys must have gecko blood or something because this guy got on the sly mall and he just went right up it the problem was that we hadn't really looked at carefully it like the upper section and we just thought get past the slime part it will get easier well it didn't get easier it went from slime to dirt which was good but it went from 80 degrees to like 90 so he went for like another 20 feet up the dirt by putting his hands in all the way up to his shoulders and he told it was like grabbing onto roots and kicking his feet in like he was like ice climbing this eventually brought him to a roof of vegetation and we looked up and we saw him up there were like oh man this is bad you know and we're like he'll figure it out but he has to because he can't down climate so he's got his arms and all the way like this and he starts going like this and he starts head-butting the wall and we're all looking at each other like this bad his head but in the wall and then I wanted the head but he bit on anyone any tore off a little patch of moss they're like wow now he's biting the cliff I've never seen that never seen anyone do that well he starts biting off chunks and we quickly realized like he's chewing a hole through the wall and he chewed the hole big enough to like get his head started and then he started burrowing into it and he he turned into Mole Man and took a long time over the course of like about an hour and a half he borrowed his way all the way into the dirt the last thing I saw was his legs sticking out in the back and he was like this and he was shaken to try to get himself deeper and I remember one of his shoes fly off and spin through the mist and disappear off the ledge and for the rest of the trip he had one shoe but he did it and he borrowed all the way through and he got out onto the ledge and we couldn't see him at this point but he let loose with this blood-curdling scream that I think was like half triumph in half like terror and the story was they heard it in the village 40 miles away but he was definitely stoked and he allowed the expedition to proceed we made a little camp up here on this reg and we have this one last little little hill to get to the base so I get up early in the morning before everybody else and honestly I was feeling I'm like I'm making the amerindian guys do the hardest stuff like I gotta redeem myself now it's matted dead wood laying over the clef it's really steep but instead of being slime it's rotten wood and I'm trying to climb it it's all just breaking off and but there's it's like this layer and a couple of times the whole thing collapses and I fall through into the inside and I look up and I can see that there's like a space on the on the inside it's almost like kind of like a chimney that you could slither up and I looked up in there and I thought what would Edward do I'm like I'm like he would go in for sure I'm like that's what I'm doing I'm going more man so I put my hood up I cinched everything up and i started squirming my way up through here and i was in there for hours and straight up there are tarantulas scorpions it was wicked-hot it was probably the nastiest thing I've ever done in my life finally I hit a wall at the end I broke all the wood and veg out o above me and I popped out and the amerindian guys are sitting there there looking at me and they're like Marco where the hell have you been I was like I was like down under I was doing like what you did yesterday they were like you idiot like we found this trail around the side like we've been here for hours waiting for you well don't forget we have told National Geographic that we're going to climb up onto the veg patch and we're going to try to find some some new species but the veg isn't really where you want to be on these cliffs the badges is a nightmare actually we kind of found this route where we hit a little veg patch part way we dug in we we actually got some samples every time you would stick your hand into the wall and you would pull it out you would have either a tarantula or a scorpion in your we had slightly more scorpion so we ended up calling our climb the Scorpion wall we had an awesome adventure up on this mountain we're on the mountain in the background there and we were flying away in a helicopter we fly over this other two pooey Bruce doesn't even know about it he's been on 32 expeditions here and as we go over the top we see this giant sinkhole and there's a forest down inside and so Bruce looks at that Inn in he he thinks you know what that is exactly the kind of place where I need to go because it's an environment that's right in between the two pooey summits and the jungle down below and I think like this missing link type of frog that i'm looking for is going to be down in that hole and my only job is to get Bruce down in the hole and then to get Bruce back out of the hole so we get Bruce down into the hole and we leave them down it's it's really the kind of wet and nasty down in there so we have this nice dry camp up on the top so we go back up to our camp and we hang out and we drink scotch and we look down in and we see Bruce down in there like the frogs he's basically nocturnal and we hear him rooting around and he's got to find this thing but he's having a hard time finding it and it's like day after day and here's a little video clip that that tells the story pretty good about what happened to bros down in the hole and they're on a little leaf SAT one of these priceless little babies and then I whoo they do what the lower elevation one does this may sit on leads and I start looking within 10 minutes i found another one and then by 9:30 I found for this is fabulous I i do want to stay another night I'd like to do some more work on the collagen that my camera with me but I know you on and on and on the other yacht about we're successful after you found the Frog we had like a little celebration down the hall and Bruce fell over there was a tree right there and he actually broke the tree off it is like super lucky because he was going to hit the ground like a sack of potatoes I'm thinking okay I got to get this guy out of the hole so here's another little clip showing how I got him out I'm trying to set up basically the beefiest rig that I've ever set up in my life just to make sure that that we can get Bruce I pretty much tied together this entire troll forest i think i have 10 trees interlinked this is one of the crazier things that I've ever set up i can confirm that he just moved up about six inches so he's got a hundred and ninety nine and a half feet to go well we did it and we got him Bruce loves to show this picture and if he was here he would tell you that I tried to kill him but I did have a back-up rope so i had two ropes but he likes to sort of pretend that didn't happen but it's a it's one of his stories so Bruce's looked at the DNA of the purple toads and guess what he found the separation is only like a few thousand years the two parties have been isolated for more like millions so what does that mean it means that the frogs have been climbing up and down and there's exchange going on between the frogs that live down in the jungle and the frogs that live up on the top with this one there's another species that he's found that has been separated from its cousins by millions of years and so bruce says to me that makes perfect sense because those ones are so you have both things going on at the same time so you have the old paradigm and you have the new paradigm so the guys 71 his first rappel is a free hanging your pal into a sinkhole on to pooey kind of a tough place to learn how to do

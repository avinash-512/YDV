so this gun has made out of pretty much all found materials the spirit self made out of a piece of steel rod has a simple but effective barb here to keep the fish from wriggling off and escaping the other end of the spear has these little grooves filed into the end of it that fit into a trigger meat out of a found rusty nail it locks in there like that then the piece of inner tube with wire attached to the end it's into a group like this is locked and loaded hairpin trigger amazing time to put my homemade weapon to the test spearfishing is a complex combination of skills that requires breath control extreme concentration and excellent hand-eye coordination yeah and just one element out of sync can make the whole enterprise impossible you just get to see anything when your goggles fill up with water i'm still working out the bugs with my new boggles these are constructed from a single piece of hand-carved wood and a section of window glass and are custom made for each individual diver they're designed to last under these waters and mine are now doing their job but the fish I'm coming across our small and fast and extremely hard to hit trying to go down and stocking fish can hold your breath everything just gets frustrating down there i need to remember to relax like the Baja they are the best divers I've ever known often starting before they can walk and improving long into old age their ability under water has been compared to sea otters and nothing distracts them from their ultimate target

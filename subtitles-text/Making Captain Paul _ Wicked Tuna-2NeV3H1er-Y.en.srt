is a hack it belongs on the back deck is no business running about as far as I'm concerned Paul will always be a mate he's not a captain in my eyes I truly do not think it would be as much of a threat as he is this season boy was I wrong he is right on Mickael ball is in the right frame of mind you know what he's done is not the crew in you know all the drama what's going on over there he's really a good fisherman you watch still gonna be on in like a power there's a billion join around so many beijing it's not even funny we're gonna catch twenty great and then wake this season being a captain of a boat that I actually own has been really tough the biggest learning curve I've had this year has been trying to manage people I meet my crew feel unappreciated and that is not what a good captain us they did what anybody would have done and then I fish find myself and then the guys came back but Lance had me second guess in light choices at the most stupid thing I ever heard of somebody's mouth I realized this just was not gonna work wetlands he's a good man but the gamble is all on me all the bills are all on May 3rd generation tuna fishermen I need to be able to trust my own and tanks right at almost alone time thank God I got Brad I'll tell you that he is really really stuck with me he's the best angle I've ever been with them my life hundred feet 300 it's so satisfying to prove that everyone that doubted me as a captain and there's a lot of doubters that I can win this whole thing because I'm telling you right now it's gonna happen dealt with a lot of crap this season including me but he's stuck it out he hit his stride as a captain here proud of those bluefin family of three come to dinner they will serve you serve giant blue they have three calling the bluefin variety of three

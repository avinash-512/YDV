what kind of thrills do you get in life is a jumping out of a perfectly good airplanes is it rock climbing my grip in new york city at a time when it was quite dangerous to two thousand homicides a year streets were dangerous and so I felt the risk of death every day I walked down i don't i don't take risks unless i have talent in the thing that might be risky for someone else to do so then when I see people hey let's go jump out of airplanes with parachutes are saying why all because it's thrilling and it's fun and it's risky and I'm thinking I risk i have risks every day for an expert rock climber and you're climbing rupture so that's risky not for an expert of all the ways that might die my parachute not opening will not be one of them ok put checking that box not happening no no of all the ways i might die freezing to death in a mountain crevasse is not one of falling off a cliff face will I that's for sure yeah

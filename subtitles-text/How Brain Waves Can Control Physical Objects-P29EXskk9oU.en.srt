tip over tip over tip over tip getting it mind control oil again hey guys Julia here for dnews I wanted to control things with my mind since forever well mostly since i saw Matilda when I was a kid well you don't have superpowers maybe technology can help me out brain-computer interfaces or bc i are just like that sounds devices that connect your brain to a computer they can read your mind and make things move we might seem like a fantasy it's 2016 baby and it's here it's real and they have many uses they're often a powerful aid to those with severe disabilities that inhibit movements like quadriplegic injuries or those with cerebral palsy they help people communicate walk and even drive a car seriously recently Chinese researchers introduce a prototype for a mind-controlled car this particular technology uses an EEG or electroencephalogram made up of 16 sensors on a cap that reads electric signals from the brain just by thinking the controller can make the car move forward and backward and even come to a stop but before you get too excited the researchers from nan Chi university don't intend to actually produce one of these cars was more practice and seeing how useful such attack can be especially for those with although the BCCI tech was first research the 1970s has come a long way in the past few decades they work by measuring the signals brainwaves get off these kinds of brain-computer interfaces can't read your every thought that they can take all that electrical buzz from your brain and translated into a single command like walk forward with alarming accuracy but a lot of what's picked up its fuzzy white noise from other brain signals or electrical signals given off from muscles moving an algorithm filters the noise from the notion and that notion has to be sustained conscious intentional activity according to research given at the annual international conference of the iee engineering in medicine and biology society some eeee geez can translate intention ninety-eight percent of the time now people like paraplegic individuals can browse the web and write emails by moving a mentally controlled mouse but it's still a slow going and cumbersome process the system has to learn the patient singles to both the patient and the computer learning the process at the same time so it could take months of practice and training because many b/ci spelling systems flash different letters on a screen and you have to think something like yes for the letter you want the bc i read that change in your brain waves so you can imagine that it would take time just to write your name some systems reportedly take a minute just to type out less than 10 characters as for walking EG controlled exoskeletons help people who lost control of their legs walk again but they take a whole crew of physical therapist to help wire someone into the machine so they aren't as high tech toys but if you're more curious about the novelty factor this tech is already hitting the toy market like the car can only go forwards or backwards toys like Star Wars science force trainer only send a ball blowing up a tube but more complicated gadgets are on the horizon one study published in the Journal of neural engineering and that a person can control a drone through an obstacle course just by the power of their thoughts how cool is that we know you love watching online but we're excited to announce dnews is now on science channel trace and amy will be sharing a minute of the best and science in between awesome programming so check out as science presents dnews and nine every week Monday through Friday and use your Twitter to let them know if you want more so the power of the mind is pretty awesome but your mind isn't the only way to control tech the human body is full of kinetic energy potential energy heat and electricity maybe we can use these resources for energy to find out more about how your body can be a power plant check out this episode right here the pzt uses millimeter scale batteries in a flexible base to generate and store electrical energy from human motion if they implant a pzt onto a heart muscle the beating of the heart would produce enough electricity to power a pacemaker or a biometric sensor so I really want to know use one of these mind-control gadgets didn't live up to your expectations let me know down in the comments below don't forget to hit those like and subscribe buttons don't miss a single dnews

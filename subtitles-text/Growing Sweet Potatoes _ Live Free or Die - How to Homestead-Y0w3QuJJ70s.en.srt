yeah this is how you go sweet potatoes this is the first step get the sweet potatoes ok the next step is to get some some potting soil so I'm gonna bury him down in there and then they go into a hot spot and then they'll spring in action and start making what is called slips and we're going to come back and pull the slips off of them in a few weeks these ones look ready these are little slips so a slip is a tiny piece of sweet potato vine that will turn into a whole new sweet potato plant already is what we're going to grow the sweet potatoes then in a box of wood chips little freaked out in there let's get some water here very important that you give them a lot of water for like the first month put a little jar over it and that's continuing that greenhouse effect because you want to keep it hot and then come to fall you just knock the box over if it's not already rotten by that point and you pick up the sweet potatoes you have the dick it's pretty cool

most people don't know that archaeologists make discoveries out of asian trash you can a lot of information from ancient times and you might dig impressive building you know you find custom architecture but you don't find this like human artifacts that you find normally in a dump I dog lots of trash from modern 20th century French deposit at the Damascus it all including like newspaper and French medicine and like French flasks crashes more revealing because it's unintentional people don't think two other people might judge them from there so remember when you're throwing away your cash a future archaeologists is going to dig through it you might not realize that something like one in 200 the world genetically related to chickens con so he was obviously very prolific yeah but it makes sense because it's not just him but it's also his sons and all of his grandsons they would wipe out enemies that weren't in there any edge

there's humpbacks like I think they're going to come up under me right now I don't know where they went there so close alive we're paddling maybe 50 yards away from each other and Brian scenes is to humpbacks just kind of like checking us out curious the most magical thing I think I've ever experienced the Baja project was really an effort to like get to know baja in the most intimate way possible Ultimate Adventure we did 600 miles of hiking and four miles of standard power because a hundred eleven days the first five days of the stand-up paddle for the worst of the trip like i was paddling and literally going nowhere pretty much on a treadmill because the wind the waves were just keeping in 11 area we got caught on this island for about three days during heavy winds it was really bad you're good on the fourth day it was clear that was going to stay calm for at least like a couple hours and we were really breaking it to make it to the other side because we didn't know when this win was going to pick up again like we already get into trouble there it would be unlikely that we would survive and so we are actually taking a big risk in stopping for these whales only crack how we've been safe and just continue to paddle to shore thinking about the win the whole time we would have never been able to interact with these humpbacks like if you're too cautious you're gonna miss out there's something about the misadventure that kind of makes up the whole adventure my mind is blown right pretty pretty

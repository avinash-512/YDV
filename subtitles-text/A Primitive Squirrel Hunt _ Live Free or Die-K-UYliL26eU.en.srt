yeah this is a squirrel all right there you can actually see fingernails in the squirrel in some of these track patterns here so it's a good sign that they're here in fact I just heard one trip over there let's keep it hunter-gatherer Matt must have a steady source of game to survive here long term it will require using every weapon at hand is atlatl can deliver a 90 mile-an-hour kill shot with pinpoint accuracy perfect for hunting squirrel as I'm approaching something like this world basically on creating a bluff squirrel already sees me so i cant stock it that's out of the question so the idea is to move fluid and smooth the point where I'm putting brush in between me and squirrel and what that does is it allows the movement of the outlet on to be blocked so the small animal can't see me throw ok I felt like I needed to take a moment just to give things for the gift of this body so i could continue to go on

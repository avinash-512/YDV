yeah I haven't been eating much I'm pretty much down to survival ration so I'm looking for a sign of rodents seeing right here kind of a cave-like formation flying go back there see what i can find in the deep canyons of Arizona desert Nomad Tobias searches for a source of protein near his new primitive camp he hasn't eaten the meal in almost seven days there's a lot of debris from rodent activity back in here I'm seeing little tracks over there a little bit of burrowing and so forth runs really like edges they like to kind of feel safe i think this is a decent place to start making some deadfall traps so this is kind of how the trap get set and so I'm going to put the date is far back under this trap as I can get it so there's a little bit of apple on the end I've got enough Apple to bait traps but none for myself what will happen is the critter will come in and it will see that bait and we'll start trap pull on it and the Rock will fall on it I'm really depending on getting something with these traps because i really don't have any other protein coming in on just small little give it basically the seat

I hate winter it's cold it's great it gets dark so dang early turns out your body hates it too hey guys Julia here for dnews winter is rock for those of us who live in cold climates as the windshield dips below zero degrees you ask yourself why do I live somewhere where the air hurts my face but it's not just the cold that's rough on our bodies it's the lack of sunlight to almost all living things have a circadian rhythm that changes with light from sleep cycles hibernation light regulates most of life on earth the earth is tilted at a comfortable 23.5 this means that at some parts of the year the northern hemisphere leans slightly closer to the Sun and other parts of the year the southern hemisphere gets a little cozier with his son and with that it means the amount of light that reaches your little section of the planet changes throughout the year those gray skies and fading evening light can have profound changes on your body the change in light can cause problems like seasonal affective disorder a condition which brings about a low mood as levels of sunlight induced vitamin D drop but there's a few other lesser-known effects of less sunlight and a study published in the journal drug metabolism and disposition researchers found how less sunlight changes how your body metabolizes medication they focused on two types of immune suppressing drugs take your limits and Cyril limits basically the more vitamin D the more an enzyme cyp3a4 is produced the more of this enzyme the faster the drugs are metabolized well the study focused on just these two medications the researchers think that these results may be true for other types of medications so the study suggests that sunlight could affect your sensitivity to certain drugs and another study from the American College of Cardiology found that cholesterol levels vary from season to season and a large study of over 2.8 million adults researchers from Johns Hopkins ciccarone center for the prevention of heart disease and that for many people cholesterol levels seem to be higher in the winter the researchers think that less sunlight plays a role in these rising levels as we are exposed to less light during the winter because of staying inside or shorter days we get less vitamin D another study menopause found a link between more vitamin D and lower cholesterol levels so with less vitamin D cholesterol levels might ride but even though more research is needed here there's other evidence that shows how your body takes a whopping in the winter so much so that it affects your jeans one study published in the journal Nature communications found that around twenty three percent of human genome expression changes from season to season mostly to boost your immune system this time of year is prime cold and flu season so to fight off infections your body switches on certain pro-inflammatory genes or DNA is made up of two strains that wrap around each other in the famous double helix structure to get even more compact and tiny that DNA is wrapped around little proteins called histones think about thread is wrapped around a spool that's kind of what his toes look like when DNA needs to be translated to make proteins these histones unraveled to let out a little bit of DNA at a time for which histones unravel when depends on various influences in this case it's seasonal influences probably again the amount of sunlight and the participants went through winter months no matter what hemisphere they were in a lack of sunlight seem to activate these pro-inflammatory jeans and like we know from other g news episodes inflammation while I can help us fight off some infections too much can also harm our health leading to heart disease diabetes or stress-related mental health issues which interestingly the authors think this inflammation could also be another visit for more cardiovascular deaths in the winter but if you live somewhere where there isn't a winter your immune system is impacted by other kinds of seasonal changes and this study the researchers found that those who live in Gambia have seasonal peaks correlated with the rainy season which is June october when infectious diseases seem to be more prevalent so happy winter to everybody who's in it enjoy your body's changes i hope this season brings you for joy that it brings cardiovascular psychiatric or inflammatory issues or maybe if you wait long enough climate change could take away our season starting with fall to find out more about the end of autumn trace has the scoop in this episode right here the warmer fall of the future will cause tree's leaves to stay green or longer and then drop early shortening how much time we can actually enjoy it Plus temperature shifts let more insects move north attacking trees that may not have been exposed to them in the past are you a fan of winter love to build snowmen in the was an outdoors are you a curl up by the fire with a good but kind of

so you probably heard of the name Genghis Khan or dingus but might not realize that something like one in 200 men in the world genetically related to James Caan so he was obviously very prolific yeah but it makes sense because it's not just him but it's also his sons and all of his grandsons they would wipe out enemies that weren't in their lineage there's more to this story than you thought dingus khan was first motivated by a girl according to the secret history of the Mongols as legend he was betrothed to a young girl they didn't talk to each other but he went to this horrible . where his father had been killed his horses have been stolen from him and his family and then he was enslaved and through all this time you know over the years she waited for one day escape from all of this went out and found as they're riding along these enemies shoulda she turns to me and says you have to go you have to run and he rides off towards this mountain and he's heartbroken and prayed to ping li hid we should do and the moment that he decided he was gonna fight back global history changed for that was the very first fight that he ever had any got her back and within a single lifetime created the largest continuous Empire human history from nothing and was all love story i would say that he was very charismatic scientists thought that chameleons change color by changing the pigment in their skin not sure how they actually changed dollar is far more complex

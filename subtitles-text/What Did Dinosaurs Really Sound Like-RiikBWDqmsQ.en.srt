the creators of the movie Jurassic Park use sounds from a baby elephant alligator and tiger combined to bring the dinosaur roar to life audiences loved it but scientists not so much their terror lizards trace here for dnews dinosaurs have been gone for 65 million years so no human has ever heard one roar never in the movies dinosaurs had sustained echoing howls but in real life nah bro a paper from 2009's historical biology attempted to reveal exactly what some of these animals may have sounded like and let me tell you t-rex probably didn't roar instead the king of the dinosaurs may have just said there may be nothing at all first there is no fossilized evidence of dinosaur voice boxes voice boxes are made of flesh so they don't fossilize and thus we will probably never know without a shadow of a doubt with these animals really sounded like but paleontologist Phil center researched the vocalizations of living dinosaur e & relatives to try and make an educated guess 66 million years ago at the end of the mesozoic era most dinosaurs went extinct in the KT extinction event ninety-five percent of the birds we have today according to their DNA evolved from any small dinosaurs not killed by the KT event 10 million years after that the first shared ancestor of all living modern crocodiles evolved and they remained relatively unchanged ever since so by looking at birds and crocodiles scientists figure we might find some hint at what dinosaurs sounded like to roar animals have to have a voice box and in the case of Crocs and birds they come in different types crocs use a larynx the same kind of organ miss you and me birds use a little different organ called a shrinks which generates birdsong dr. Julia Clark of the University of Texas at Austin told me in an email the shrinks had no precursor organ it evolved with birds after dinosaur extinction and from fossil evidence we know the larynx did the same so because birds and Crocs and their voice boxes evolved after the mass extinction of dinosaurs researchers posit they're commonly shared ancestor dinosaur probably couldn't vocalize it all essentially we know dinosaurs didn't roar because they didn't involve voice boxes until later as far as we know but just because they didn't roar doesn't mean they didn't make noise a paper and anatomical record points out many dinosaurs had nasal cavities and clouds and connective noses this connection inside of the skull created residence chambers which allows animals to create all sorts of sounds even without the larynx or shrinks and literally on top of that the Lambeosaurus and hadrosaurus had massive resonating crests connected to their breathing tracks which researchers think could amplify those noises even further we found fossils of these crests so they can prove it in some researchers blue air through them to show that they could have produced low-frequency sounds just like modern Crocs and some elephants so even though that in roar dinosaurs could have drummed grown history gurgled click rattled trip to interrupt just like their modern relatives calling out that you're the best at hunting or mating is super important in the animal world that's why we vocalize but calling out your portfolio of photos books are Kanye gifts and gifs is super important in the internet world what better way to do that with your own website and no domain extension will help you tell your story like a.com or.net domain name because you watch TV news you can get fifteen percent off domain.com names and web hosting use the code dnews when you check out and it will help the show - so thanks if you're looking for more dinosaur stuff you should take a second to watch my other science show and podcast test-tube plus over on ttp we dive deep into the controversy of the earliest Dino discoveries have some dinosaurs that you know might not actually be real the black market of dinosaur fossils and how we might even be able to bring these bad boys back and according to professor of history of science and technology at keele university in the UK q torrents Owens key contribution was not just dreaming up this cool charismatic name terrible lizard which they aren't so Owen come on man they're not even lizards does it bother you when Hollywood make stuff about dinosaurs like why didn't velociraptors have feathers in the movies dinosaurs had feathers made up let me know your thoughts down in the comments and please subscribe to dnews you'll get all of our videos we make them every day all week yeah

one of the most mysterious and unexplored areas left on this planet is the ocean floor we know next to nothing about it we don't know what's down there what creatures lurk in its depths or even what it looks like but gravity it might be able to lend us a hand hey guys Julia here for dnews scientists recently used what's called gravity mapping to map the ocean floor and just like that sounds it's when satellites measure gravity to tell the topography of a place in a study published in the journal science researchers merge data from two satellites to reveal the underwater map the satellites cry us at two and Jason one measure the distance from their location in space to the surface of the land or water on Earth after filtering out all the noise from waves and other temporary changes in the ocean surface the satellites found certain areas in the ocean with more gravity than others that's because the mass of a mountain under the ocean has more gravitational pool than the water around it so the water kind of piles up on top of the mountain and creates different heights on the surface of the a lower area has less gravity than a higher area because there's less mass using these changes a gravity scientists can measure the sea floor by measuring the surface of the the results confirm some previous data on the bottom of the ocean and found some new discoveries - journal earth and planetary science letters researchers announced the discovery of a tiny new tectonic plate called the Mavericks microplate well most tectonic plates are huge like thousands of kilometers across this little guy is just a hundred fifty kilometers across about half the size of England while tiny and broke off of a much bigger plate when the Indian plate and the Eurasian Plate crash into each other about 47 million years ago this map reveals how little we know about the world around us we've only mapped about point zero five percent of the ocean floor to our highest level of resolution with sonar most recently we are using gravity mapping but 2,000 years guys were just throwing measured ropes into the ocean with weights on the ends there's still a lot we don't know we do know gravity is an equally distributed around our how much gravity you experience at a specific point on the surface can change because earth is more oblong and spherical it's not equally dens and the distance from the center of the earth to where you stand can vary gravity's pull on you knowing all this gravitational mapping has helped reveal new information about our planet like a study published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters found that the lowest acceleration due to gravity it was on Mount Nevada wash Quran in Peru while the highest is in the Arctic Ocean as New Scientist puts it if you fell from a height of a hundred meters you would hit the surface in Peru about 16 milliseconds later than an Arctic weird right so why do we care besides the whole weighing less on a mountain in Peru thing well it's helpful for building things engineers need to know the local gravity layout when designing buildings and infrastructure and of course measuring gravity is awesome just for a better understanding of the bottom of the ocean maybe we'll finally know exactly what our home planet looks like the oceans take up over seventy percent of this planet's surface yet we know so little about them trace fills you in on all the bottomless details we know over on test 2 plus almost a third of our planet is the Pacific Ocean and in case you're wondering in terms of measurement that is 1.87 quintillion gallons it's a lot of water so map nerds out there what is your favorite imager map of our pale blue dot let me know down in the comments below don't forget to hit those like and subscribe buttons and keep coming back to dnews we've got new episodes every day the week

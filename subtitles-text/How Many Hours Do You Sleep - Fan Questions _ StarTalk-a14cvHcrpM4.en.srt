ok I sleep on average five and half hours a day and on the weekends I sleep in and sleep for seven-and-a-half hours that being said if I have an opportunity to take a nap no matter what else is going on i'm taking a nap so maybe in total of seven days it'll it'll come up higher than five and a half hours but in any given 24 hours it's five and half over to me sleep remains one of the most curious things about animals event explaining sleep to an alien but what you gonna do now well i'm going to lay down and be semi-comatose for a third of check back with me later what what why I don't know my body needs it why I don't know it's just a little embarrassing in a conversation with aliens or maybe the aliens sleep more but we take sleep as a given when I can imagine life forms that don't require it at all what a waste of productive time

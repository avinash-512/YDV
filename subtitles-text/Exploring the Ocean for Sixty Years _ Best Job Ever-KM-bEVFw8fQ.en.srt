even if you've never seen the ocean or touch the ocean the ocean touches you every breath you take every drop of water you drink it's the ocean solution for me being a biologist just following my heart has led me to some fascinating places yeah what is held my attention all these years its life in the ocean that's where most of life on Earth actually lives as a scientist I love nothing more than being an explorer discovering the nature of life itself that sense of eureka huh you got a thousand is really tough to do unless you have some special friend like this is a wonderful passport into the scientists are like little kids who never quite grew up don't ever stop asking the who what why where when how baby whales and dolphins as some of these questions but they may wonder what stars on it may wonder what's in the depths of the ocean below where they swim but only humans have the capacity to really answer those questions we think only about ten percent of the ocean has cancino or sampled at all we're just beginning to assess the magnitude of our ignorance and at the same time that we're learning more we're also discovering how much we're losing must be a thousand fish share more how do you save the ocean you find others who have a similar goal and together you find ways means of working with people who have the power to make decisions that ultimately result in protection for a place that you love so what happens all of us depend on these ecosystems and there are incredibly in some ways they're incredibly resilient if we do the right thing but they're also regret it's a magical sight that endless horizon it just stretches out to blue infiniti jump in the ocean and there you find happiness one every five breaths you take come from this tiny little organism called rope or campus they produce 20-percent the oxygen in the atmosphere

this incredible art that mostly dates between 10 and 40,000 years ago what we often think of course is the animals but there's another enormous group called the geometric lines that old number the animals and humans at most sites by a ratio of two to one or more so jun 2014 myself and my husband and project photographer Dylan we're at northern Spain we're at a site called kuvira cave and we were so excited to finally be there could be a very the entrances 30 meters up it's a hundred feet it's a cathedral entrance in a wooded hillside in the foothills of the Pyrenees there's like a whole wreath of dangling green vines coming down its inviting it wants you to come in and so I can understand why people may have decided to go in there 14,000 years ago what's a little more difficult to understand is why they decided to go so far in because the very first art is 780 meters half a mile into the case you can probably just see some faint pigment markings on the wall that is not model graffiti these are not animals but they're not writing either these are the geometric science they came half a mile to the cave to make these if we enhance it you can see a little bit more this is a very cool color enhancement program created by american rock researcher John Harmon and suddenly you can see more but still no animals nothing as far as the eye can see this is very unusual animals are normally found everywhere but don't worry we've got to keep going a little farther so we keep going three-quarters of a mile in and there's another little passageway here with two horses the animals are represented there just a completely different section of cave and as you can see they're very simple but we've also have all this detail that kind of lets you know that there's something going on there's a hint here there's some artistic ability its underlying what they're doing here we got two horses that's it you keep going a little farther and now there's a little crevice off to the right this time and somebody went up there to make these little dots let me enhance it for you but these little dots somebody took their finger and dipped in paint and made those marks and as so often happens when I find myself in these places I'm like what were you doing why did you come three-quarters of a mile or 1.2 kilometers in a cave to make thoughts so let me introduce you to some of the Paleolithic stone age art that the animals are by far the majority of what we call figurative a representational art a lot of hunting animals we've already seen a horse here's a deer we have a fabulous purple base and it's the only one of its kind because most of the art when it's painted is either red or black and so this fabulous purple base and I would just love him hes like this unique little guy hanging out in northern Spain so we've got him and then also we do have a few other figurative images of humans and this is engraving this is the other way that they made the art but there's another geometric signs that outnumber or more they can be simple things like the circle they can be more complex things like this incredibly complicated sign that was located in this panel and spain which is a one-off it's the only one of its kind in the world they can be . they can be lines they can be triangles you so that the full range everything that's abstract and that's kind of how they've been defined over the years abstract characters that don't represent anything from the mundane world so let me tell you some of my phone results there are only 32 signs across the entire continent and a 30,000 year time period my friends these are not random doodles are decorations so was i noticed was that this is actually each one of them has its own distinct patterning to these are not all doing the same thing they're doing different things in different places so there were patterns across space and time and that's what's so intriguing and exciting so let me show you a couple of those patterns this is a child's hand this is 27 thousand-year-old child's hand now hands are fascinating one because they're at their most popular at the very earliest time periods between 30 minutes between 25 and 40 thousand is when we find hands after that they start to fade out of popularity until they vanish towards the end of the ice age they just go away people stopped making them so that's one pattern another pattern is very interesting is this is called detective form so this is like a roof shaped and these are only made in the northern region of france between 30,000 and 17,000 years we're all located except for one site 250 miles to the south across the Pyrenees Mountains in Spain and it is exactly the same have talked to the researcher that site we've looked at pictures even down to the little dots you can see the technique that was used it's the exact same thing how did it get there this is what's so fun about the signs is that we can actually follow people and ideas that these incredible time depths and get a sense of how their culture was developing how are they learning about symbolism what was going on so we've got these signs that were being used very purposefully by people who obviously know what they meant the obvious question people always want to know is it writing and i'm sorry i'm here today to show that it's not ready yet though this inscription as it's called is called the inscription malossi again this is a one-off and this is the thing we don't have the consistency yet we don't have enough characters to represent spoken languages we're not there yet but that doesn't mean that there's not very interesting things going on it's really funny because i just spent all this time building my nice little list of 32 and now my next job is probably going to be the smash it back apart because there are some major omissions there where's the landscape features where's the weaponry where's the daily life did nobody look up at the sky you know and so I think that personally and this is what we're starting to dig into know i think a lot of these geometric signs might actually be representational as well and it could give us some fascinating insight into the ematic categories and how these people were understanding their world quick example the pennant form subpoena for means feather shaped in Latin it's being treated as a geometric sign but there are contexts such as this where people of muttered it kind of looks like a tree so my response would be maybe a tree sometimes it's just a tree maybe we don't have to over complicate this and so this is the kind of thing we're looking at as well as questions about clusters of dots potentially being constellations or other things which would make really good sense and we see another Rock our traditions what I've done so far is just the baseline this was the start those were some really simple questions there is so much left to be done in Europe one big category that was still missing here is that my database does not have any of the portable art and yet and yet the sixteen thousand year old necklace for instance from a burial in France has 45 different geometric configurations on it think about how that can help me understand what I'm seeing on a big panel on a wall they seem to be starting to group them up that line the cross the line i've seen that on a cave all about 50 miles from there so this is part of the story and there are dusty artifacts loitering all over Europe in museums waiting to be documented so this is very much the start and imagine if we can start expanding the work that I've been doing in Western Europe to a global level now those would be some very big patterns thank you

I'm a vegetarian and i'm kinda small and i am a meat eater and I'm pretty big but in the rest of the animal kingdom it's just the opposite hey guys Julia and trace here for dnews take a look across the African savannah and you'll see massive animals like 16 elephants in 1.4 ton giraffes you lonely spot a few top predators like 350-pound lions and a hundred sixty pound cheetahs the top five largest land animals on the planet are all plant-eaters why are so many herbivores so much larger than carnivores well some researchers think it's an evolutionary advantage it's harder to take down an elephant if you're just one lion that's why they have almost no natural predators or maybe it's what they eat some researchers think herbivores grow so big so their stomachs have more room to digest the massive amount of plant material that they need to survive and that plant material is actually really healthy for them it's where the most energy is as you move up the food chain from producers like plants to consumers like herbivores and carnivores energy conservation gets lost this is in line with the second law of thermodynamics Matthew Lewis Senior Program Officer for African species conservation at the World Wildlife Fund says there's a ten percent loss of energy at each stage for moved from France but it's hard work to get all the nutrients they need out of plants so many plant eaters have to spend most of their day eating plants elephants for example between 200 and 600 pounds of food a day and we'll spend up to 18 hours just eating that's a lot of time being sounds okay my college even the evolution of big plant eaters takes a while according to a study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences it takes 24 million generations for an animal to get really large over the past 70 million years the authors conclude that since it takes so much time to get big earth isn't likely to see another animal like the elephant as long as humans remain the dominant species the way predators hunt will also affect their size according to a study published in PLoS ONE hunters typically travel large distances to find their prey the hunt includes an intense chase and take down all of these things take enormous amounts of energy so the ratio of energy intake and expenditure constrains large predator sighs the researchers found that a big carnivore can't get any bigger than one time one of the lead authors said carnivores because of the cost of hunting can never achieve the sizes and intake rate of prey of the largest herbivores other researchers believe it's the way predators are built that might limit their size animals that exclusively eat meat like cats for example need to have a flexed limb stance in order to pounce on their prey a bigger body like something over 440 pounds wouldn't support something like that stance a small female giraffe good way seventeen hundred and sixty pounds while a large male lion might only way around 400 pounds so meat-eater the size of an elephant just not be an efficient predator this supports an early idea from a colleges paul collins bow who believes that a predator has to expend a lot of energy hunting down their food so having a large body to support would be cumbersome that is why he believes think fierce animals are rare and they're rare in other ways too is we mentioned earlier there's often more prey than predators in an ecosystem this is an evolutionary advantage to keep populations in check if you have too many predators the wind up gobbling all their food up and then they won't have any more and they'll start a big animals to conserve its energy for the next meal mostly by sleeping so the best predator is rare not too big and kind of lazy sounds like a kitty we're kinda like me so how big do you think humans can get to find out that answer check out this video right here the reason we don't just keep getting larger is we actually have to live in the world gravity is constantly pulling us down requiring our bodies to create bones which counteract that forced to hold us up are you really big vegetarian or like a really small carnivores let us know down in the comments and keep coming back here every day for more dnews see you next me too wanna go grab a burger the veggie burger

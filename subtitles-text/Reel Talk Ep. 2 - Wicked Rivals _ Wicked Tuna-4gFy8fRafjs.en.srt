we get to know real talk alright and we are on you just watch the latest episode of wicked tuna and that's a pretty explosive ending we will explore it's time for wicked tuna real talk the weekly web show were different captain's will join us and give their take on the latest episode employ a lot to talk about on this one my name is mike stock i'll be your host today joining us this week captain TJ on the Hot Tuna captain Tyler McLaughlin of the pinwheel of course captain Dave Carraro the fishing vessel tuna.com guys welcome to the show and tyler Dave I'm I'm glad we were able to get you guys sit next to each other kind of a tough moment between you two at the end want to give you both a chance to explain what you think happened and look Dave we saw kind of bad week for you and everything just seemed to be going wrong all the fish seem to fall off the line for whatever reason you're dealing with pink slime then you get tyler coming around your boat how are you feeling that the am not feeling very good you know bad week efficient and I gotta deal with him just that just a combination for a recipe for disaster right now use the phrase bad kid you think I was a bad kid not a bad kid he's a bad adult what does that mean give me one more you know I mean Tyler's Tyler you know I've always get an apprentice a good fisherman he knows what's going on he catches fish but if he would mature a little bit and they could be that much more of a better person he's not a kid he's an adult he just needs to grow up did you think this was the one we're going to try to get through to him is this your most mature moment I'm just reacting like anybody else would have reacted and tyler from your side of it you say Dave takes life too seriously as the line he said they're in the show why why go mess with somebody that you know isn't gonna have fun with it well you know fishing is like good release for me it's something we should have fun with the guys saying it so seriously news on good numbers and you know after the season he put me through last year he really handed me my butt and you know we're really sticking the wood doing this season's or try to catch a lot of fish and that's the only way you're going to really get it this guy's you want to push his buttons you gotta put me on the dock you think you gotta push his buttons yeah definitely you know he's my biggest competitor on the show we going head-to-head for a while and it's really important that I out fishing every year that's what I mean if you're gonna make a statement don't attempt to trash my poly ball catch fish make a statement i do catch it did you know that catch fish make a statement that way we know it's just fun it's fun now once you've got it all up I know I don't want to grow up so they seem to me you grow up grown ups having no fun I like laughing and having a good time and not taking too much serious see that when did when you watch riu you say very clearly in the show that you believe he's he's trying to go pop your ankle ball on purpose and you can hear him say hey we're gonna go mess with them and have a good time how do you feel watching it back later I don't see that you know anything that he does his previous as far as I'm concerned is considered a threat i saw what he did there I know what he's done in the past and I know what he's capable of doing in the future that's what I'm saying feet if I think he grows up i'll respect the more I respect him as a fisherman but I don't respect him as a person TJ you're not really a fighter from all that I've gathered about you how do you feel watching these two guys get after it is pretty comical I mean the poly ball massacre man yeah I ice you know whatever I understand how short message the guy that then dave is doing what he thinks he has to do but I want no part of it it's baby stuff as far as I'm concerned you choose sides on something like that i mean you know both these guys pretty well I know man i'm switching I'm in the middle I don't know honestly Tyler was messing with him Dave took the wrong way but you know I'm just glad I was involved in it so your first doc confrontation no no no i'm not bringing enough for any of us open our door just as that's that's just part of fishing whether it's with him or somebody else TJ and he's been it otherwise it would probably mean we've been we were like playing around there like I was trying to just razzin I didn't know I was gonna make it that extreme reaction happening Ralph yeah definitely forgot about why another that wasn't my fault again I don't know that you liked Ralph the black cloud of the finite background with what happened there I hear you but you know when you try to have a good time somewhere all out there fishing when you spend so many days on the water it's nice to interject with other boats and I kind of enjoy the internet by the way but those two good times you had didn't turn out too well did it ever fine i mean i ended up just fine i mean i've been doing all my talking with tail ropes you didn't end up fine you end up on your back one time you are probably on the face the second time that's pretty sure it wasn't that great possible lesson learned let's move on it did your preview just the last thing you're pretty calm guy but I think that's what sort of jumps out here it's not just seeing two guys fighting the dock and the fact that there's an anchor ball involved certainly adds that comedy value for me but what is it that actually got under your skin regardless of what it is you know when you poke the high life finally gonna get stung by the B and it you know what you saw there was just part of it there's a little more to it than that there's a lot of other little of occurrences that did happen but that was just the straw that broke again keeps a fight to that wasn't a fight that doesn't count i I've seen guys fight that was kind of like two girls bigger than the bathroom haha that was a fight when it comes to me i'll say i think it's just you know gave definitely season is a big threat he know to him it's all he's got to be the best year in year out and I think that when i'm on my game i can take them off being the top boat and that really drives him nuts I don't know he smoked this last year you're gonna see you did two years ago he did he stuck to it then Johnny it was five times good you did 3 times 5 15 I mean listen I got a batch of pneumonia is in the hospital I was sick as a dog while you were catching fish so I was even on the water like a madman excuses well i'm not out there is kinda hard is not probable around anywhere is it no I think we're all the table or somebody was after him with a mug i'm jumping out of the way I'll tell you that right now obviously this news is gonna travel throughout the fleet and how does this divide the fleet how do i was this news received elsewhere it got around pretty pretty quickly I think within minutes people are starting to talk about it people love it they feed on it to a lot of interaction I mean listen a lot of people want to see these two guys fail till they both catch a lot of fish there's a lot of people that don't catch nearly as many so you know when they hear stuff like that they left i think it's great you know they find you know happiness in their drama I mean come on you're going to tell me that like if you're like some of the top producers in your industry you're not gonna go head-to-head with your biggest competition you're not going to poke at him as I am that's why getting your head it's like a tennis match I'm doing everything I can to try and make apply to get you to react to drop your game just a little bit and my whole goal this year was to get inside days head and I wanted to do it from day one because i knew i was going to catch a lot of fish and i think i did a good job doing that because when he paid me a visit i knew i was in his head I knew that taking off his game fishing did it take you off your game Dave I'm gonna do anything to if i doing that just makes me more motivated it makes me want to succeed even more why does this happen so much in efficient if I see this guy catch a fish next to me i'm pissed and I'm really upset about it so I think there's a real high stakes in this these fish with a lot of things since I stress and when everybody's got a high stress you're under a short fuse is it the waiting is that what does it matter the more I i watch the more I see you guys out there and just think about now we're watching in the course of an hour a week boiled down into an hour i think about how much time you spend just sitting and waiting to hear that beep beeping of the marketing I that I would think it would kind of start to get under your skin a little bit we do because it's a labor of passion we love it you know but uh moments like that definitely as a grandma well we can see it fishing is definitely a tough game as we've seen in the first two episodes this year of wicked tuna things don't always go according to plan for every single boat Dave you won big last year right and and it just really it seemed like everything came together Tyler's come out very hot at the beginning of this year very strong start he's actually ahead of you first two weeks of fishing towers already caught 42 @ ej you've got three have only managed to have one fish so far Dave almost all the fleet's ahead of you so much pressure does that put on you that's a lot of pressure you know we want to be that top boat and being this far behind it's gonna be it's gonna be quite a feat to try to get back and get to where they are and bypassing but you know it's not how many fish you have now so how many fish having a week it's what you have at the end of the year that matters still got a long way to go and we can make it happen how up and down is this business I mean it in a jet come and I'm seeing it on the show or still worse to come on haha why is it is it i mean that that's why I wonder about the lock thing I mean is that does the effort change year to year or is it just sort of the up-and-down lock of the season something you know that's not I mean you know you're not always going to be the top of you can't always win the superbowl you know sometimes you should have went north wind shit you know when you went south sometimes you shouldn't east when you should have went west you know sometimes you just don't make all the right moves and you know title last year was a perfect example the perfect example of that but that might change this year you never know and a lot of us to the mood on the boat too if you get a couple fish on deck early and the mood on the boat is good you guys are happy and you feel like your point in the right direction it the rod seems to bend a lot easier but if you get you know in a funk right out of the gate sometimes it's just better flash evaluate and you never feel like you're gonna get it back and I've been on that end of it as well and all you guys have different mates or around you at some point this year how important is getting that chemistry right so that as you said the vibe is a good you and you're just sitting there waiting huge if everyone is it on the same page things can go bad quick definitely it's tough i'm gonna go through meets all the time it's hard to find a young kids like my age so I want you can you bring our spending the time living with that person on the boat for you know six months of whack and it's hard to find a person you can do that year in and year out with me I literally put the person on my boat and take some pak-rat living all around New England to me go fishing wherever we got to go and it's just it's hard to find kids that don't want to sleep 24 hours a day like any it's impossible that I can't get a kid to stay up at night if I didn't know about how would i pay more what I offer incentives it stuff or what speaking of deckhands and new deckhands tju we get to meet a new mate of yours this year that's your brother Mike and what we have here quite a bit about back in the day and there's like punches being thrown yeah and can you guys coexist together out there and yeah yeah we can we can't you know he's a very strong personality is very stubborn and I never dreamed I would be honestly fishing with him like I did this year one because we're very different he's very at you he gets very a grown very aggressive quick you know where i'm kinda like think it through and Michael came at a very slow you know he was kind of like a zombie he's caught lots of fish in the past he hasn't done it years we brought on board this year thinking hey we shake things up a little bit and I definitely question that the beginning for sure I like when the rod bends not about to say word you know everyone knows our I hate and when it comes to the time to start the fishtail road the fish everyone knows where everything is and and Michael was definitely slow to that it'll come there's no doubt i mean day when you watch your bow when you guys are catching fish it seems to be the comest of any of the boats that there formatted time together the longest you know how many eyes on her second he knows what I'm thinking somebody's been on the boat for seven years now you know it's just it's you're going to be nut butter he's thinking peanut butter yeah all right you guys almost never seem to be at odds with a job where we're on the same page we're on the same page and when I hired Sandra Sandra never fished he never really has been on a boat before and when I hire people i like to get someone with no experience this way i can condition / mol them the way i want this way again too many behave yeah yeah yeah yeah we want as a good leader battle LOL and i don't want one of that little dj why don't we are getting many Tyler's I mean again more more new as you said you'd like to bring in different people because it's hard to find the right person you feel like you you're getting closer this year to find the right kind of guy for your boat yet travis has been is really stepping up to the plate for ministries he's on his game he's fished a lot in his life he just never fished her big bluefin tunas before so it's definitely been a good experience of trying to mold him but he's definitely see some habits that he's already developed that are trying to worry me like what sleeping okay you just you how much do you do not sleep are you one of these guys are like to whatever you like but like the captain's kind of figure out when the fish are coming through and we kind of sleep around when we need to be productive and you're gonna get your mates to step up during that period of time because you can get a bite at any point time if you got a sleeping condition and you can't sleep on land go out about for a few days without ya makes it real quick why just talking about it you know you get out there and you're you're up around the clock trying to make bait do things and and that you know right five and I sleep out there way better than I ever do online at how much of the boat success is the captain how much of it is the crew through its reciprocal I think it's you know no way to put a number on mon you're handling . and the herald square little color on you have the boat in the right spot to I mean ultimately my mates don't tell me what to do that you know we all try to surround say what you want to do but at the other day I'm the one saying drop the anchor here and I'm dependent on them to you know get good bait in the well get the tack already stuff like that so it's definitely a team well that's where we are guys it's good to have you here for wicked tuna real talk at once again I want to

this is a story of two species on the beaches of Mexico fighting to survive these endangered olive ridley turtles and the impoverished humans who hunt and sell their ex don't remember a time when I went to our packaging up you're not a medical background that what we are doing here or i don't think we're down by now you know you know getting a little when you get on like a man given a common people total legs have been a part of local culture for centuries but taking and selling them was outlawed in 1990 and it's now a federal crime punishable with up to nine years in prison depriving people of one of the few sources of income they had but when it comes to putting food on the table even the Lord one stop them going somewhere where all is calm all right or not ok are being up on your word you're not looking to store be this is miguel he's from a village on the beach and like many people here he started coaching ex when he was a young boy well I'm which I hint in his deposit it into a part of one sec that you're working ok today in those cases on the little more little more little the turtles like fifty to a hundred eggs at a time they buried them in small mess before heading back to the ocean humans use a stick to find the hollow ground and locate the mists we spent hours traveling around different villages going from house to house talking to poach with Miguel knows it felt like everybody around here hunter takes even women and children we hope to film people at home to show how they lived but because a hunting is a federal nobody wanted to talk on camera during the peak landing periods when thousands of turtles arrived Marines and environmental inspectors are sent in to protect the beach from poachers it makes it much harder for the poachers to go out but many still take the risk this year they even started using surveillance drawings a contar para que seguro en este momento que canta esta haciendo una vida pero como estan las donas de que no se puede ver quien está buscando una camisa es de bien por esa persona que la que simplemente te entiendo o en este okay Doris those como estamos igual que la gente que pasa de trabajo no quiero con este es uno momento porque la toda la noche know your circadian noche a las otras noticias much i'm indy en esta vez en dos que NOS estamos viendo los detalles y todavia estamos en español you're taking it out of play about the case in Munich a co-ed an hour okay i dont la diosa cuento que me but they got this holiday so quickly and I feel equal to the world when we have been it Amelia had to split a little easy way of solar you know me know when it happens that but what all these security measures are taken on the beach the total legs are openly sold in local markets so in the market which done is crazy no eggs sale everywhere even though it's completely legal and it's actually a federal crime I've heard of journalists getting a camera smashed it so I'm just acting on the tourists and filming on a cell phone while I can't believe that they send in the Marines you're such a big showdown the piece of people don't take the X and completely allow the sale of the eggs in the market and the authorities don't seem to be doing anything valley so that's definitely the double standard is going on I asked the district attorney for Environmental Protection how this was possible el mercado de to represent a para nosotros el pollo Rojo mas grande que tenemos el estado de mas que probarlo mooch estrategia de no solamente day maternal mercado de determinar algun otro tipo de conflict ocls uma vez de la torre de steaming ill completo para el no es mi amigo cuando socio-political the feeling around here is the egg poaching will only stop if the government provide alternatives porque no no yo no sé de da de da de da de la comunidad de poner una de empleo y de su una empleado de elección de huevos con el otro lugar para que esta pasando interlude y se pueden hacer mucho projectors trabajo en denver 10 de niro back in which each time we went for lunch at a local family-run restaurant like many places here total legs or even listed on the menu everybody in which it i knew the eggs were illegal but few seem to know about the turtles being in danger of extinction if the amigo bueno livable pero no porque no pro or even no digo que tiene muy efecto de algo de medicina en field whatever no no bro you even broke up with Indian country the struggle between the two species continues with each side fighting for its offspring while the numbers decline worldwide the totals will continue arriving to the beach too late Eric's and until other opportunities present themselves the humans will continue to steal them food on the table for their families

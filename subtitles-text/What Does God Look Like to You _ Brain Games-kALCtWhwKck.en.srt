for many people God is the strongest belief they have but how does your brain conceive of the very idea of God what happens when you actually try to draw the divine dr. Andrew Newberg from Jefferson University Hospital has been trying to figure that out we've asked a few people of various ages to draw God for the break we also asked you how do you envision the almighty did it look like an old man in a cloud a beautiful scene from nature or something more abstract let's take a look at what our volunteers came up with and then we'll reveal what your image of God says about your brain all right and could ask everyone to put their pencils crayons brushes down I what did you draw thank you God and had been and like a bridge leading at and the sun shining down I do a kind of a judeo-christian kind of God looking over our realm my home it's my heaven you know everything else that happens around us know what I think God means is that looks like it's much more of an idea than a person and basically all the colors work is on everyone's different ideas of what God is what it means to me as they got his love and they encompass of different colors I drew big ? few years ago I would have just left it blank incredibly when asked to envision God of all the seemingly infinite possibilities people really only draw one of three things there are certain kind of general categories that people think about God from and one of them is the idea of God as a kind of person we see a face we see eyes we see up an actual person it's just easier for us as human beings to relate to something which is infinite in a very personal kind of way to start virtually all the younger artists depict God with a face or some anthropic quality now as people kind of move away from thinking about God only has a person we start to see more of a symbol like the cross or perhaps clouds and then sometimes we start to see just nature itself and finally we start to see people moving into a more abstract way of thinking about God different swirls colors a heart even a question mark was that true in your images at did your picture of any higher power look like a person or abstract science shows that the shift to more abstract thinking about God occurs around 12 years of age what might drive this development in your brain according to dr. newburgh the vision of God as a human figure is often aligned with a wrathful more authoritarian view of God and this picture of God may cause primitive parts of your brain to release stress inducing neuro chemicals changing your picture of God is something more abstract may in fact cause you to be more optimistic and faithful so ultimately this tells us something about how human beings actually perceive God think about God think about God visually which is obviously one of our most powerful senses that we use to understand our world maybe when it comes to your brain the old saying is true seeing is believing

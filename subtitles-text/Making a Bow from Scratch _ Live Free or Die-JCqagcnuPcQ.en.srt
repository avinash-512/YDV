yeah I think I see one right through let's call they're just not shooting fast enough i'm not being very productive and getting small games but i need the food so it's pretty important that i'm able to do some successful rabbit hunting I'm going to stay in this area super high in protein vitamins and minerals rabid me became popular during the Great Depression when American families began raising their own me to survive these lean years today commercially sold rabbit goes for about six dollars a pound about four times the price of chicken I feel like I'm more accurate with a bow and arrow so if i can get a bow made maybe that'll give me an edge that will let me make those difficult shots basically just using a hatchet a knife and so not having modern tools does make it more challenging there goes this is going to be a pretty basic simple bow and I'm just trying to get something that's functional it looks pretty good for coming out of a log earlier I have more invested in this NGO working than just going out to shoot a target for fun so I'm really trying to do everything I know how to do to make sure that it's successful I've got this string that I've carried with me this whole way i'm going to call that good for now hopefully as it dries out it'll stiffen up a little bit need to make some arrows this is the arrow shafts i harvested the other day i think i'm going to try to do three feather fletching on the arrow the three feathers seem to fly a little better so it's not too pretty but i got them on there and use some pine pitch glue to kind of cement the ends down help it stay in place looks we'll see how flied time to go hunting

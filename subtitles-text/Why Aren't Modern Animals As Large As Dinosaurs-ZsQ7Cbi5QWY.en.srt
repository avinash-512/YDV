hey evolution why aren't giant pets of thing yet huh if dinosaurs grew enough to fill a whole room why can't i have a big red dog the size of a house hey everyone was that here for dnews particle captures our imagination about dinosaurs is just how huge some of them work the american museum of natural history has a cast of a tight i'ma store that's so big it doesn't completely fit in the dinosaur wing the 37 meter-long behemoths head have to poke out towards the elevators it's got individual bones bigger than people the very name of the group of dinosaurs it belongs to have the word tighten in it but when you start to consider the size of some of these extinct species it can make you a philosoraptor why isn't any land animal this huge today you may wonder well you're not the only one lucky for us paleontologists have been debating the same question and they've come up with a number of different factors that could explain why some giant reptiles of yesteryear dwarf modern land creatures it's important to keep in mind that dinosaurs lived a long time ago no daughter right but what you may not realize is that before the dinosaurs were wiped out they were living on a completely different kind of Earth that we live in today dinosaurs actually started coming on to the scene about 230 million years before present during their existence co2 levels were all over the place estimates vary but for some stretches there could have been three to five times as much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as there is today this means the world as a whole was a lot hotter even at higher latitudes and because at the beginning of the Mesozoic era all and was clumped together in Pangaea the ocean didn't have as much of a cooling effect on the supercontinent this would make the planet a more hospitable place for I don't know giant cold-blooded reptiles that wouldn't have to waste energy maintaining body heat see another reason to working about global warming get out of that SUV and onto a bike unless you want to see T Rexes in your sideview mirror it may come for you to know that paleontologists aren't all in agreement on the exact amount the atmosphere impacted dinosaur sighs it could have had no effect at all and whether or not dinosaurs were all cold-blooded even up for debate their size could have also been driven by an abundance of food all that co2 meant there was likely more vegetation if there's plentiful vegetation than large herbivores can thrive they actually benefit from being bigger because longer intestines would be better at breaking down plant matter and extracting its nutrients then they could spend less time chewing and more time stuffing green down there giant bullets also if the herbivores grew larger than they were harder for predators to take down until the Predators got bigger than the herbivores would get bigger than the Predators would get bigger again you see this is where I'm going and it's not good but there is an upper limit two thighs because of physical constraints like gravity part of the reason well as get so huge is because the ocean supports their weight on land a similar-sized animal would crush itself without some clever life hacks huge dinosaurs like sauropods had lightly bones compared to mammals because there's were hollow dinosaurs also had another advantage over when it comes to live in large they laid eggs if they had to give birth to live young it would be much harder for them to have large offspring quickly for instance elephants have 22 months of gestation periods they can't breathe very quickly because life birth is so resource intensive and it requires a large birth canal interestingly these traits of hollow bones and egg lane have come in handy in a very different way today they make it possible for the descendants of dinosaurs to fly that's right I'm talking about birds why they were so big is still a matter of debate and hopefully we'll find more research out there but at the moment they're trying to put together a hundred million year old puzzle with a lot of missing pieces want to learn more about huge saltwater creatures that are alive today don't miss new episodes of river monsters every thursday and 9:00 8:00 central on animal planet seriously about dinosaurs equal birds here's a video all about their gradual shift from ferocious predators to feathered peckers separate research also published in science last month theorizes that all dinosaurs had feathers somewhere more primitive like hairs are bristles while others were soft and downy like modern Birds so are you glad giant reptiles no longer run amuck or what you want a pet raptor share your thoughts in the comments and remember to subscribe to dnews you never miss an episode thanks for watching guys

you dream every night now you might be yelling at me that you don't but you're wrong just because you don't remember it doesn't mean it didn't happen everyone dreams even animals hello lovers and dreamers Lissette here for dnews when your head hits the pillow at night and you fall into deep slumber you dream and we're not alone according to you and well some old research animals are dreamers to of course there's no way to ask an animal once it wakes up if it was dreaming but science point to yes most animals dream and it all comes back to rapid eye movement or rent we sleep in stages REM sleep is the final stage in your sleep cycle and when dreaming occurs like a lot of things in the brain it is still a mystery but scientists think REM sleep has to do with storing memories and learning when REM sleep starts your body sends signals to your cerebral cortex where learning organizing and thinking occur signals are also sent to your spinal cord where neurons are shut off this causes temporary paralysis of your limb muscles so you don't act out your dreams meanwhile random signals are also sent to your cortex and some scientists think this is where dreams come from having dreams are your brain trying to make sense of these random signals creating something like a story so basically its scientists observed REM sleep and animals they can conclude that those animals are dreaming or to put it in a more sciency way patrick mcnamara director of evolutionary neurobehavioral laboratory at Boston University says it is reasonable to suppose that animals have something like what we call dreams until recently REM sleep cycles were only seen in mammals and some birds but researchers in Germany might have discovered that reptile stream to researchers put probes inside the brains of five bearded dragons to measure electric physical activity while they slept and they found that they had sleep stages similar to that of ramming humans so dreams or again something like what we call dreams the lizard's average 350 REM cycles lasting about 80 seconds each to put that into context humans can experience five REM cycles a night of more than an hour each the REM sleep isn't the only way we've been able to tell animal stream scientists can watch animals sleep and how they move just like your family pooch but remember how the brain paralyzes us so we don't act out well in 1959 a French neuroscientist alter the part of a cat spring that is responsible for this so in the cat fell asleep it moved all sorts of ways scientists observed in raising its head our teen its back and overall appearing as if it were stocking or hunting prey and scientists have even studied what animals dream about research done at MIT looked at rat's brain patterns when they were in REM sleep and found they were similar to brain patterns measured when they were running through Amy's when awake they figure the rats were dreaming about their daily maze running the two measurements were so alike that scientists could conclude where the rats were in the dream maze a study was also done on zebra finches that found they might be practicing their songs while they slept but what does this all mean well it helps us understand our brain a little bit more but also a little bit more about evolution if a similar sleep pattern is occurring in the brains of mammals birds and lizards that means it likely existed in our common ancestor the amnio which existed about 320 million years ago suggesting fleet patterns may have evolved a hundred million years earlier than we previously thought do you do about crazy things maybe you should start an online dream journal through a website domain.com can help you do that no domain extension will help you tell your story like a.com or.net domain name and because you watch the news you can get fifty percent off domain comms names and web hosting by using the code dnews when you check out but even with all that sleep is still pretty crazy over on dnews plus trace looked at lucid dreaming dream monitors and even if we could someday record what we're dreaming about check it out here after hooking people up to electroencephalograph they found that they were in REM sleep by looking at their brainwaves then by signaling with their eye movements with predetermined eye movements they were able to to say that they were aware they're dreaming what's the craziest dream you've had lately running mazes stalking prey share your thoughts in the comments and remember to subscribe so you never miss an episode of dnews thanks for watching

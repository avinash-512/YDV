the I'm happy to answer straight out what was going on before the Big Bang ok we have no idea pets they have struck the way we define time is beginning at the Big Bang so I was not clear what it would mean to think of time before the we would need some other understanding of the universe to give us access to before the Big Bang that we can think about modifying the definition print have time to include that but until that day comes it working with what we got time begins at the big banks space being and my son was gonna be something before it no that doesn't have to be if I tell you did what more and you go north and professional you meet Santa Claus and then I say keep going north he said there I can't keep going like a Miss North as I can be it's not different from me tell you go far back in time you go back to the big bang and then if you keep going further back no this is where it begins I can go farther back in time than the beginning any more than you can go farther north than the normal

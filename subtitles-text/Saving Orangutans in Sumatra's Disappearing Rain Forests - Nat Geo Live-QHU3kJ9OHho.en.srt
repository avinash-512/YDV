in Sumatra the electrical system is one of the largest and most intact tropical rainforest left in Southeast Asia it is the only place in the world where have Sumatran tigers Sumatran rhinos from a turn elephant and around 10 leaving together in the same place at the same time unfortunately the logical system the forest shrinking for the last 15 years I had been dedicating my life to saving around turns these are on danse are living in the lowest rating system in the island of sumatra indonesia so the forest of orangutan is really really appreciate and not just or on cans that depends on this forest for the survival but humans depends on this forest for many many reasons and i would say that the Arlington is actually the guardian of the forest because they actually keep regenerating you know they keep planting three stay at the best gardener of the forest and that means actually add a symbol of our fight against global warming unfortunately the local system the forest in Sumatra and also emporium shrinking because of the bad planning even the electrical system is not even recognize in the government special plan eighty percent of the other hope that has been gone mainly for plantation and not just don't and a suffering because they're losing head with that but also many other animals become victims of human what like conflict and for a long time being stranded is a problem is a big trouble for them because they can go anywhere we cannot find food and a piece like this showing you like you can go anywhere and you faced starvation and you can imagine that like we did with this kind of situation we are unconscious have not trace left to go back to the forest and people can get access to actually shoot the mother and get the baby for pit this is a big male around then kept there for 20 years you can see this small door there when he was actually taken it when he was very small now he's lucky because she's not in sifting and this gentleman look at that handsome and but unfortunately this guy is actually really really in trouble but he's leaving in a very small for dispatch and we tried to bring him into a safety so we come to the plant is an area and we check every time for a spot left in the presentation they surrounded by family plantation and sometimes we found this things that is said no man can survive in the plantation and we have to rescue when we rescued or I'm done a lot of the twist of a topic like this like that you can see that very risky dangerous but we have to do it anyway otherwise they are in trouble being shot in or capture or even die for starvation and then we have to get the mother check the health while the arms and still actually sleep because of the anesthetic because we actually went to Les Deux around 10 and not just young around then but also mail around and that we have to rescue this massive animal any up to really carry and safety sometimes we have to go find a very best crossing the river and we sometimes have to cross you know so I bit swamp and then we have to move them into a safety in the interval asif forest and he's like a happy momentum when I see actually ordered them being released is a freedom this is something that we want to do we want to achieve this is our final goal to keep for us as forest we want to secure a happy that so we chopped down illegal immoral trees and we plan them with forest trees and that is actually make that my son planting place with me and then this is just showing you how we plant trees for growing a forest from beginning and we actually look at from the top and 45 years actually got this so it's just really really promising and I believe that this is like bringing you a new yet we can do something we can help our nature and not only that but animals coming bags and then this actually read verses are becoming a playground for many many animals so not only that but also many many people local people coming to learn and join us to actually help with the project and this being just bring a good momentum for local people that we can still save for us so it's never too late to save our nature so you can do your own beyond part and i believe you can contribute in your own way so please join me and safe our in forests and mountains thank you

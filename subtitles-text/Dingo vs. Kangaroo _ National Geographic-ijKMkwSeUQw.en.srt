Australia's wild dog the dingo is on the prowl today at hunts alone assign the dingo is probably on the lookout for small game but it senses a larger opportunity a baby kangaroo called a Joey makes an excellent target it's too big for his mother to carry if she has to run away the dingoes slinks forward while the Joey unaware keeps busy grooming himself his mother senses a nearby predator but it's not the dingo her attention is fixed on the wedge-tailed eagle line above his mother calls Joey to her side neither one sees the dingo approaching through the brush for a moment a young male freezes his panic proves contagious the mother and her Joey make their getaway to the dingo burst after the ruse the dingoes no slouch when it comes to speed but the ruse reach 35 miles per hour dingoes have better luck hunting in packs when they're after large kangaroos it's back to searching for prey that's not so big and not so fast

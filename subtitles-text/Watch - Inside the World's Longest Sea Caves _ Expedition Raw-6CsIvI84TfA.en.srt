and actually went to New Zealand to study the other side of the island but satisfying my curiosity I start exploring this coastline and that turned out to be the day that i actually discovered the longest sea cave in the world on this coastline that's only about a mile long it contains six of the ten longest sea caves in the world including the two longest it's really exciting you get to an entrance and you really have no idea what's going to happen pushing down that next passage maybe the swells sort of resting up to the ceiling and you might have to hold your breath just to go through to the next part and you don't know if that's the end of the cave or if it's going to open up into a big room full of beautiful formations or interesting to see light these caves have some really impressive tape formations in them that as they slowly trip they record climate through time just like tree rings - it's one small piece of the global climate puzzle then we can start looking at things like what's the erosion rate because the way see case for ms by eroding coastlines we're mapping these caves using both traditional 2d cave survey and also newer three-dimensional surveying based on photography we can get texture on the cave walls of all these features in addition to the shape and morphology of the case but we still have a lot of work to do because with caves you truly don't know what you're getting yourself into until you get yourself into them it's true exploration

so one thing that really surprised me was from 1970 2010 you know in 40 years we've lost over half our wildlife populations in 2014 there's a study that was done basically what they do is they look at elephants and tigers and and fish and and all these sorts of animals that we consider very very important they look at how they change over time and they found that from 1972 2010 we had a fifty-two percent decline in those numbers and it wasn't until we started industrial Isaac everything industrializing fishing industrializing energy production and all these kinds of things where we started to really impact these environments in a way that was never no one more sustainable and it's not until we see the impact that it has on the environment impact it has on other species that we start to think twice about what we're doing the amazing thing about a lot of these ecosystems and the amazing thing about the environment is it's actually pretty resilient to change and so if we just stopped doing the small things that are damaging it it'll bounce back you have to believe that we can make a difference that we can save the species or we can protect these areas and that it's not a lost cause one thing that maybe people don't know is that there are low in the dark

this is what brought to your son's birthday party is when you have a birthday party at the museum we gotta do and take you places you have been before you feel that how does this mean heavy again the Academy Awards higher compared so we're made of Stardust right yes it is this this is part of me forged in the heart of a dying star yes and this is this is mostly iron hand so it is likely that the very same star that created this iron created the end it's in this as well as the iron in your blood I find that really cool you have a kinship yeah it's deep as well so meteorites a reminder for us the earth moves in a shooting gallery that's my first thought when I think of meteorites cuz we get it by them but also there's a colleague of mine who did a calculation and it turns out that if you add up all the iron in the hemoglobin of all the residents of the New York metropolitan area it's about the same amount of iron as we have in that meteorite so just even thought to calculate that that was cool and so it's a little reminder scientific reminder that we are Stardust and we've come from the same points of origins so I'm impressed that she was impressed by that cuz she prompted that memory within me for me to bring out the meteorite and Emily would you would you agree that this is a powerful is a powerful stuff kinda thinkin made this famous we r star stuff to think about it is one thing but to hold it and she like went down a little bit you can see that on the clip because it's so because it we're used to earth rocks which also have magnesium and silicon things in them but this is ironed thanks to the middle of an asteroid way back in the day and so it's way heavier than we would expect for an earth rock and so people take it and don't expect it to be so have to hold you look like wait a bit more than they look i've got big boned this has been a big boned

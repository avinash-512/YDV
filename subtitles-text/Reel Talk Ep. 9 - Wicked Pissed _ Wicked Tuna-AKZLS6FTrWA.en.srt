we get to know real talk you just saw the new episode of wicked tuna now it's time for we can tune a real talk with some of Gloucester's bluefin captain's share their thoughts on the week of fishing i'll be your host my name is mike s'alright in this episode we got three captains in fact a fourth members well we'll get to that captain Paul Lieber to the Kelly Anne Morrow dibacco owner of the Kellyanne is here with us as well captain Dave Marciano hard merchandise and captain Tyler McLaughlin of the pinwheel here as well thank you all for being with us today tensions have been mounting on your boat guys the Kellyanne things came to a head this week the episode ended with a bombshell revelation from morrow that he's planning to send Paul packet see you later take a look everything's an uphill battle that's how it's gonna be just some people might look nice but they're really not good people there's no doubt in my mind Kenny and I could take this bold go out and catch fish I'll go home and talk to the family i'll come back and say we're done it's been awhile i mean but you've been thrown off boats before what would it be like to be without a boat at this stage that is this stage of the season it's too late to run another boat it's way too late to like get regroup tomorrow you see that clip you remember what's been going on the boat what can you say about Paul and his leadership at this point tensions were definitely high when you're not catching you're not getting paid it's it's a lot of grinded and you start to question everything at this point you sure seemed as if there's a lot of regret are you regretting your decision to hire Paul yes I was past time we going home with no money in my pocket with a $MONEY bill all you guys together all having some issues of there because the rest of the fleet over your work smoking and we're catchin fish catchin yeah just get on the same page John it back to what it was but last year when you cut 319 everyone goes throw it all that's gonna be hard i mean both both both morrow and Kenny were pretty rough on you they're pretty honest both both professionally and also really personally let's take a look at that I've never spoken to people the way i get spoken to on this boat mr. motivation you should take a motivated seminar something he's gonna be a captain because they ain't gonna make it someone forcing any peace of mind I work so hard i need the money but he's not doing one who needs money marcus three kids why we're in last place it's clear as day because it's an eye on me instead of a week and iceberg you know we do we survive . we got a couple fights we lose fish becoming a joke yeah Paul wasn't just your fishing decisions really that they seem to be looking at everything in examining everything that you're doing from lashing decisions through your leadership to your personality to your work ethic yeah how do those accusations like handling the grind it wears on you this this for a living is not for everybody we're actually all have crazy to do this for a living to give up real jobs to do this feast or famine job for a living but this is all I have I don't know anything else did you know that you're upsetting the guys that much oh yeah oh yeah and yeah rise expert at that you don't have to get all of the morning didn't you just not care of you enjoy the straight no you don't enjoy it if you try to get some Sun shot of it Tyler you know when you've got these guys have caught only three fish so far this year clearly there's some leadership issues or some chemistry issues on that boat how much of a role do you think that plays in the lack of tunic or as a vice versa well obviously I've been there in the past I've had tough year it just seems you know they got a lot going on there that they can't get on the same program if you know that's the different here the Paul's coming way up in the main is coming into different areas and you know the rest of the fleet were all catching fish in doing well and it seems like their boat is an absolute catastrophe Dave what do you think why it was Paul lagging behind with this boat were caged it's a tough racket right in there right when you haven't things aren't going right and you're not making money everybody can get each other's nerves right and this is one of the things that takes time as a skipper kinda learn that even when it's his worst as it gets someone's gonna you know keep altogether right against and that's a skill that's learned over time you'd only be no matter how bad it is you got to keep the you know the upbeat pace and you know again will we go through it on a boat you don't think you are right you know I've had my share of meltdowns don't know maybe once in awhile and he saved a change or still recovering from the water company weeks ago yeah but many times you want it it's it's it's like that that's a hard thing especially when you're not catchin fish because I everybody is giving a hundred percent well let me ask you specifically Paul me and Mauro says if you were using your own money maybe you would act a little bit differently on the boat you think that's true it in a way when you have a bowl all the expenses come out of the fish so when you catch a fish you take all the expenses out but there's still a big nut that we have to come ahead of those expenses to make money at the time that we put in on you really going to catch it really going to make 50 grand to make money you owe me because it costs like you know ten grand ball at five grand bay Hawks lead is beyond me but I think it's a lot of dress that weighs on you but if you let it get to you it will ruin the whole season tell what do you think I'm not sitting out here for five days of whack want my rod to bend over and reel in a fish for an hour and then break them off you got to use adequate tackle and if you're not using 200 220 pound test line you have no business being out on the oh cool you put 150 out you bet your rod you want to fish for 10 or 15 minutes and he bit through the long never use regulations now without precautions got already tried as regretted it got a safety Matthews you got one whining that I've used my whole life has been one . too you know I know but you're using a Jayhawk can get the right hook up with that Paul you've told us so far in this show not today but in a previous week that you bought your own boat for next year you should be all ready to go as the captain of your own yeah has this season and some of the leadership issues made youth think we think consider how you want to do things differently all the years I've been doing this you learn what not to do it's not so much what to do what not to do and you should end up pretty good morrow what advice would you give one piece of advice on leadership of about what would you offer motivate ya if you don't yeah yeah you can make everyone feel portable likely yeah for me and like for like TJ and like elite captains and like Dave I don't know how he operates on his vote but like I said my lines TJ I know he sets his lines and like when you start having confidence in a mate that he could set the lines and you can be comfortable with that then you think that's something that your maybes always aspiring to do you're always aspiring to get to the next level of the next job or the next this so if you can just motivate your crew by Hank let them start doing tasks that they didn't use to be able to do like that they've learned and watched you do you get everyone that you get them excited you and Paul work together in North Carolina last year you guys made a pretty formidable team we're challenging moments for you with all your not so much you know Paul pretty much down your Carolina I've been fishing here with the greenstick for quite a few years pod been down green sticking in like whatta ya mean ya and I think he had trust in my ability down here I smell in the air before and he kind of just we rolled into it you know he let me run my spread i did my thing when Paula's huge when the fish is on the line that's what Paul helps you understand the way the fish move he understands how to fight the fish I i can run the boat or Paul can run the boat I can fight the fish for Paul can fight the fish it's great to have Paul the boat as you can do every task when we get up there in Maine and you've got a lot of different spots and lot of different things going on picking the right ones hard and I think it's sometimes you know getting on a new boat being a captain of a new both is a lot of pressures that come with that and I think that's why he's struggling this year I will if we learned anything from the latest episode besides the intricacies of fishing tackle it's the teamwork is everything at Paul's team fell apart Tyler struggled in his first trip out after losing his right-hand man David last week and meanwhile Marciano and his tight-knit family crew were busy landing three fish got family on the boat and that seems to be working out really really well for you you're in second place right now right behind fishing vessel tuna.com let's see what that looks like color coming in flat back and on this run it on this rug wait wait yeah we get to have a great day nice shot drop that goddamn yeah you'll find him on the rod goes on my left gonna take the job get them tight get them tight job well done the job ya got your knife it while you and your son and your nephew you guys have been rolling right along what is the secret been so far look the secret is a good team no matter who you are you need a it just goes to show you know it's not about the boat so much you need adequate bone but when you get a good team things just fall into place you know it again might get that overnight right that'll work together and live together you know James but on the boat nine years now full-time that my son has been coming since he was in pull up so you know what I mean we we know what's going on and those guys make it happen for me with without them I'll be the first to admit I wouldn't catch half as much you know without that could team behind me there's nothing but we started off here talking about chemistry and Tyler you were on top of the leaderboard when the week began but now trying to adjust to some new chemistry with only one guy in your boat you had two on the line you lost them both at once it wasn't pretty definitely got a nice one on paper here hugs double just like clothes oh my god we need David jr. going on now we got out of the fucker he's off Tyler that one came off pulled the hook better luck next me and without Tyler you end up phone from first all the way down to third place you know how big a role did David play we have to ask now how important was he getting you to where you were so far this year well I mean I went back to my typical way of doing things and i decided to hook more than one once we had to one line and you can't drive the boat fight to fish at once you know it won't let one come slack pulled off on him and pulled up on the other one Noli starline held together we didn't get shaved off because we're using adequate tackle but you know it's a bummer not having date on the boat and it's just next we gotta regroup how much of how much of a learning curve is there going to be with Travis you know this is a little bit of a learning curve with Travis but the bottom line is the one thing i like about him is he's an angler and he understands being finessed and he's caught a lot of fish in a lot of different pound test lines and he can understand how to fight it too inefficient you can as long as you have a good angle and you got a good startup package you can mold him into the perfect thing and I'm seeing that with Travis he wants to learn he wants to be there he's positive he has my back no matter what and that's what matters well we saw another boat go from three to two also this week we saw pretty nice party as well but Dave your boat is going to be down a man also as Joe heads back to college how worried are you that you're now going to have to go out and do this with two again how how important was he to you get you where you are right look he definitely was a huge help especially to because always did my son has been my good luck job it will be important to get out there this week with its with jose God my good-luck job Jay and I really get a producer fish that's going to be everything that'll keep the momentum going if we strike out I feel we're just gonna fall behind well we've seen things fall apart certainly this week on the Kelley and the fleet's for top boats however fishing vessel tuna.com hard merchandise pinwheel and Hot Tuna are all in a very tight race Dave we've heard you guys talked about it before your boat is often viewed as sort of what the the ugly duckling of the woods at the humpty dumpty yeah he's not be the same foot inside of the to the fleet they like to call us you guys are you limping around how important these final few weeks here a little more than halfway done through this season how important is it for you guys to show the rest of this fleet that it doesn't matter how big or how nice looking the boat is you can still get it done that we've showed him if nothing else we've showed up to this point you know that we can keep up with anybody with the boat we got I'm just hoping you know maybe we can keep doing it but if we don't you know what even if it ends tomorrow we've had a great season on a personal level I'm happy with that we caught some fish we made some money i got to fish with my son I could ask for nothing more when i was 16 years old I was falling hard merchandise around the ocean that I was catching fish like it was going out of style seriously David was catching fish and he was the Heighliner and Gloucester like three years in around and this guy can get it done and the fact that he's having such a hot year is dangerous how does your game plan change now going forward is only going to be two guys in the boat you want to try and stay near the top what changes you entertainment which is going to change i'm just gonna keep yelling yelling at Jade at catching fish every down there I'll handle it but not catching fish i'll have a meltdown swear words around now you know yeah it seems to have brought you quite a bit of locking three fish this weekend Tyler for you I mean you once again you're near the top of the leaderboard not necessarily at the top this week was just a couple years ago that you won this whole thing how important is it for you to show that wasn't a fluke yeah definitely wasn't a fluke me not think i put enough fish across the dock over the years before that to prove that I'm an adequate fisherman and I can hang with these guys you know the seasons got a lot left in it and there's a lot to come and I know that Travis and I we're going to get it together we catch a lot of fish alright that's all the time we've got I want to thank all these guys captain Paul ebert for the Kelly Anne Morrow dibacco as well the owner of Kellyanne captain Dave Marciano

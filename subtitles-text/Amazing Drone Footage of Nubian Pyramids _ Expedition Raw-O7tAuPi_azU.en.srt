Amazing Drone Footage of Nubian Pyramids _ Expedition Raw yeah if something goes wrong out there i'm going to be the one that has to fix it's going to be all on me and that's a lot of pressure to deal with it you don't know how close the things you are so I'd be flying at a pyramid I'm like man I really hope we don't crash into this thing because i don't i have no idea how close i am after the helicopter takes off thats it for a second with just in the air to kind of get into the perspective of the now i'm comfortable and now I can fly because i'm seeing with the helicopters i am the Jeff member links and archaeologists and he's been in Sudan for a few years now excavating a place called El crew so I was there to get aerial coverage of the pyramids being able to go in the air allows you to spatially connect all these different elements and kind of gain a better geographical understanding of what's happening at the site I remember there was these granite lions that were outside of this one temple and I'm like imagining who carved that thing you know and it's like this weird connection you have to somebody that lived an incredibly long time ago but it's also not just the connection to the past but linking a people that currently exists to this past culture the Nubians have their own culture and they were building their own pyramids they had a separate nubian kingdom it's really cool especially for the Sudanese people to get this identity that's not just associated with Egypt not what it's really great to be a part of that

a common analogy that people like to make is that if you are the first colony on Mars that's kinda like the pilgrims coming from Europe to the new world you know you're not going back you've got your loved ones your possessions a competent ship commander but there's a fundamental difference between being the first Europeans to the new world of being the first growth leads to mars the difference is when the europeans landed at plymouth rock or wherever else on the east coast of the United States and they step off of their ship onto the land they could breathe the air that the trees in the new world were made of wood so that if they damage their ship they can repair it the fruit though it was exotic to them was entirely edible and if it wasn't edible they get sick and they learn not to eat it and try a different route and by the way many of them died but we don't talk much about how many pilgrims died not only avoids over but in the first year to that they arrived they were dying even though they were still on earth so to say let's go to mars in it and now again us know you gotta bring your oxygen you gotta bring you water you gotta bring your food pretty sure there aren't monsters that will attack them that they're going to fall off the edge of the universe where they fear factors plus we've been to Mars with robots so the unknown unknowns are are significantly diminished I wouldn't mind going to mars but just to visit I can I can be there

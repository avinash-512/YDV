our goals to investigate the interactions between the bats and the geology of the cave itself so wherever the bats choose to go we follow your climbing up a slope of guano that 70 the high you sync up to the chin it's like walking up steps no one of our team members did slip on 10 and break a bone in Iran in some cases we are wearing masks in the roots because there are health concerns associated with there is back borne diseases that range from rabies that one into the other trouble prices are much less study quite serious and and it's only be contracted in some of these caves and that's your only when they take flight so there's a great deal of ammonia gas in the atmosphere and that can be quite damaging the lungs that's what bump into you land on you call up and fly off again and so on so but that's part of the experience to get closer to these animals and having crawling on you and doesn't cause them any harm doesn't cause us in your home just a cool experience

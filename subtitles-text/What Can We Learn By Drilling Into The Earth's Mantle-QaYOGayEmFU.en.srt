so guys I just learned that drilling into the earth can tell us about outer space what is going on here hello earthlings was that here for dnews scientists are drilling into the earth we all know the earth is made up of three major layers the core the mental and crust which is where we all live the crest floats on the mantel a super thick layer of mostly slow-moving rock we've been trying to reach the mental since the nineteen sixties but despite numerous expeditions have still not Doug past the crest by all accounts attempting to reach the mantle is dangerous and expensive so why are we trying so hard to get down there because the mantle can tell us a lot about the history and formation of our planet in the universe the mantle makes up about eighty four percent of the Earth's volume and is incredibly hot with temperatures that range from around a thousand degrees Celsius close to the crust to about 4,000 degrees Celsius near the core the weight of everything above it creates pressure that builds up tremendously the closer we get to the core now the chris berries from five to sixty kilometers thick with the thinnest layers found under the ocean the farthest we've got in was in the nineteen eighties in Russia's kola peninsula where they dug for 20 years and manage a 12 kilometers deep hole which was probably not even halfway to the mantle this and many expeditions have failed because of technical difficulties like improper equipment and just plain bad luck in choosing spots to drill but this doesn't mean scientists have given up more recently a team of scientists from the International ocean Discovery Program drilled into the ocean crust and were able to retrieve rocks that showed signs of life the rocks contained methane and hydrogen which has one of the researchers puts it microbes can eat to grow and form new cells this is huge similar rocks gases and conditions are found in other planets so according to the researchers these Rock specimens can aid our search and understanding of how extraterrestrial life may exist in similar inhospitable conditions in the depths of the universe for reaching the mantle doesn't just teach us about space it also teaches us about Earth the mantles activity is largely responsible for the movement of tectonic plates which scientists theorize influences volcanic activity earthquakes mountain ranges and movement in the oceans so understanding the mantle can help us better understand the its current topography and its history including our continents shifted throughout the ages and are shifting today if we can drill down to the mantle researchers could have this type of information straight from the source increasing its accuracy right now we can only make inferences about the structure of the earth based on how fast an earthquake seismic waves travel through the planet and the roots they take what we see on the crust and the composition of rock samples it wasn't too long ago that by chance a volcano rejected a diamond from the mantle that confirmed that there is an oceans worth of water in the mantles transition zone scientists learned this because it contains ringwood I'd with a certain amount of water in it now this tiny Rock made a huge difference and look these rocks are great but they're inconsistent we don't know when the next mantle Rock will be spewed out of which volcano or if it will be intact enough for scientists to derive meaningful conclusions we got lucky with this diamond but often these rocks are too damaged most have been bailed out from volcanoes ejected by tectonic plate crashes or create upward to the ocean floor these treacherous and often erratic journeys leave scars on them and leave scientists with messy data it's hard to know what characteristics were the result of the journey vs reflective of the mantle itself so drilling down to the mantle could mean that we would finally be able to get for stain samples of the mantle and even an entryway for further exploration it could give us a clear look at the mantle composition how it's moving and more accurate readings of its velocity pressure and temperature in essence with the earth and possibly the universe is made of but the drilling we most often hear of is tied to oil to learn more oil comes from check out this video over on test-tube historically we've gotten our oil from traditional drilling but nowadays almost half of those 8.8 million daily barrels are so-called tight oil that we get from hydro fracking there's been a lot of debate about that for environmental reasons but it's big business for a lot of states and if you have a bringing science question you want to answer to let us know in the comments below keep coming back here for more dnews throughout the week thanks

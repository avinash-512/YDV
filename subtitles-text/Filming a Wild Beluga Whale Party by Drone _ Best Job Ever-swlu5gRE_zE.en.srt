i'm here on Summerson island in event located about 100 miles above the arctic circle and this is my office I love this place the marshland but it's great land it's not always easy if you can brave the snow the ice and cold temperatures well you're gonna get amazing reward I'm here to photo identify beluga whales they actually congregate right behind me here approximately 2,000 beluga whales come here every summer to Walter skin socialize raise their young and it's just a big political party and hopefully with my photo identification we can identify the whales which returned to somerset island every year and their patterns in and out of the bag this is important because the Northwest Passage is opening up and will be poor ship traffic and special places like this one here forever so it's important we started these whales and make sure they're saying good yep

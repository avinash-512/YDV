whoa look at that look at that scorpion right there there are over 1,700 types of scorpion but the ones that can kill people live in the desert I have experience with species like this and know how to avoid getting stung by careful handling wow that is a venomous predator so well adapted to live in this area of the world we're not very many other animals can live these guys come out at night and if i was to accidentally step on this guy I'm have to get stung worldwide around 5,000 people die every year from scorpion stings the neurotoxins they unleash can be ten times more powerful than cyanide but i'm getting it out of here far away away from where I'm sleeping but where there's one there might be others so I'm taking no chances of ever nomads they make this it's called the tran tran is an anti scorpion agent made to an ancient berber recipe a mix of desert woods is superheated inside a closed container the resultant blend of SAP's and resins coalescence into a black viscous liquid with a pungent smell this is a traditional technique whose origins are lost but which has been passed down through many generations it's very smelly it's almost like at our but you put a little bit of this around where you sleep and scorpions will not cross this smelly stuff this will solve my scorpion issue

monogamy that that's a culturally expected even required conduct of you know it's how it's how we view relationships yeah and over the last 60 years okay so I'm gonna be never applied to men until about 60 year old so we're never explained had concubines men had access to sex workers men at multiple wives monogamy was built to imprison women to reassure men about other with their go to address males paternal insecurities you knew for sure it was hurt baby you never could know for sure it was your baby this is what accounts for the Jewish lineage unless she was locked up right you only Jewish if you get another one of the Jewish mother because you know who the mother is you never know who the father is right so wasn't until in the 20th century to go from this gendered institution in this property transaction where the husband was granted the gift of the daughter that in that truck became the wife with the dowry and all right looted and so marriage became the the equal sort of union of two autonomous individuals and expectations changed that that the same standards had to apply to both Ferris and yeah and then monogamy instead of extending to women the same license that men had always enjoyed the same latitude around monogamy we imposed on man the same restrictions that women had always endured and it it's been a disaster for marriage nothing correlates more strongly with the rise of divorce than imposing the monogamous model on them so what should happen going forward monogamish relationships fish monogamish there are people who are in a monogamous relationships now but who won't admit it because of the stigma you know people say and I often hear this from my straight readers know there's no open relationship lasts and the my response is always because you only hear about them when they failed that there are people in successful not monogamous relationships that you know you just don't know you know that it's difficult a selection effect yes very hard to compensate have two peoples to a straight couple who are not monogamous because they're swinging having threeways or somebody cheated if they divorce everybody finds out about the non-monogamy and blames it whether you sometimes even if it's irrelevant but a straight couple who are able to stay together because they're not monogamous nobody ever hears about it and nobody gives it any credit that there are couples who are together today still not despite the fact they're in an open relationship but because they're in an open relationship and when non-monogamy saves a relationship it gets no credit when non-monogamy destroys one it's a headline news headlines

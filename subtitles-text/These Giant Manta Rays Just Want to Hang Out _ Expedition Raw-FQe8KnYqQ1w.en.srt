we are at the ready heito islands 300 miles from sure off of Mexico and we're putting critter cams on giant manta rays for the first time the masses are so friendly that they just hang out with the divers so we wouldn't get any interesting footage because we just you know get selfies of ourselves from the man's perspective and so we actually had to institute a policy among our group that once there's a camera on the animal we get out of the water so that it will go do something interesting i personally think that mantas are one of if not the most amazing animals in the ocean they're incredibly graceful very intelligent they're coming and investigating you just as much as you're investigating them yeah every other big animal that lives in these open ocean habitats attends to migrate quite a lot but for mantas what we're finding is that they're pretty much staying put I hope that the intrinsic value of having mantis swimming around in our oceans is enough to convince the public to protect them but there's also a really strong argument for protecting them for economic reasons I think that having animals like mantas contributes to the planet that we live on this is what makes the oceans while we're out here putting critter cams on leopard seals we saw for the first time on video ever and act of leftover parasitism

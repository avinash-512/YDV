Nancy Reagan is a fiercely devoted champion lover guard dog of her husband she's a political person not so much in that she's an issues person but that she feels she feels the temperature in the room she can feel who's on her side and who's on her husband's side what is it a binder crowned with garbage Ronnie couldn't possibly digest this was work still he's fired do it now I think nancy was a guard dog and sometimes an attack dog so that her husband didn't have to be I think one of ronald reagan's great strengths was he was so Apple he was so good at being warm and friendly to people and that was because he wasn't suspicious of people so that was that was her child I think that one of the lessons that Nancy took away from the assassination attempt was that people weren't looking out for Ronnie well as well as they should which is not to say the secret service per se i think she's was so grateful to the Secret Service and credits them with saving her husband's life and you know but that precautions should have been taken that weren't from bulletproof vests to the way in which he was exposed on the street and all different decisions that were made that in retrospect seem very careless to her and careless may be objectively it won't happen again it mustn't I get it I understand you don't get it you don't understand it is your job to protect him she spoke to Michael diva and she said this can never happen again and she had a big effect on changing the way in which he was exposed in public i was talking to merv griffin on phone oh how is worry he's fine do you remember when he introduced me to that astrologer she certainly was reliant on astrologers up to that point but it seemed to become even more important when they said yes we could have told you if you'd come to us that that was going to be a not a good day for him are you are you telling me this woman knew i was going to be shot on march 30 years no no no no that's not what I'm saying at all what I'm saying is she could have warned her sense was always that her job was to love and protect her husband but when the apparition of assassination came onto the scene it became so real and so palpable and it guided almost every decision that she made

salt is everywhere on our planet but some animals evolved to live in it while others didn't what happened there what caused the split sup they're salty dog's trace thanks for watching dnews water is everywhere and is one of the main reasons life was able to evolve on earth it's pretty great salt is also everywhere salt and water together make up most of the water on our planet and it's a major component of the beginning of life as we know it organisms need salt to survive salt draws water out of cells in a process called Osmos asst as Moses is the tendency of water to flow across a membrane to balance salinity essentially nature wants to make sure there's a balance level of salt this is why if you drink salt water you can die of dehydration the water salt balance gets out of whack and the water gets pulled out of yourself that's pretty serious and yet as bony fish moved from a salty sea into freshwater also called sweetwater they had to eat salt to maintain that salt water balance they still do this today urinating any excess salt sometimes up to a third of their body weight a day we do this - which is why we crave and love salt but this brings us to the big question of saltwater fish are drinking salt water constantly how do we avoid dehydration due to as Moses well there are two answers one comes kind of built in the gills of some saltwater species like the flatfish turbit have adapted to carry more of a special enzyme called Gil sodium potassium 80 pace this allows their gills to reach salt from their bodies back into the ocean without this adaptation they would die because of that high salinity but some species of eel salmon bass and flounder have adaptations that let them move between fresh and saltwater species which can survive in a variety of celebrities are referred to as your heyleen some even actively adapt their gills or kidneys throughout their lives there are a lot of species Cosmo regulating in a lot of different ways you know regulating osmosis this is a great example of how evolution solves a problem along many different paths something scientists called convergent evolution which is so awesome so let me give you a couple of examples an atom is fish are born in fresh water and live there for months before they make for saltwater in Atlantic salmon and enzyme called type to di today's is produced in response to the longer daylight hours of spring puberty ain't just weird for humans this enzyme alters the Salmons gills she ating osmoregulation so they can safely swim into salty water this is reversed when they return to rivers and streams to breed and start the process with their own little Salmons and a 2013 study in molecular and cellular proteomics detailed how a different adaptation involved in tilapia when placed into salted water gradually the researchers found tilapia gills adapted producing a specialized protein they called n brg1 this let the tilapia survive in a saline environment as long as they had time to slowly adapt a lot of fish evolution has happened in the last four hundred million years fish have spread into pretty much every water based environment on the planet after the great dying 250 million years ago which wiped out ninety five percent of all marine species evolution had to figure out how to Ozma regulate again through an assortment of convergent evolutionary adaptations freshwater fish repopulated the oceans learning to deal with that super salty water eventually they made it to land as well when a fish named Houston opteron evolved into amphibians and tetrapods like you and me without salt and being able to regulate it life as we know it wouldn't exist pollution is the best saltwater fish diversity is pretty incredible thanks to evolution and this year on Animal Planet's river monsters it's all about salt water baby don't miss new episodes of river monsters every thursday at nine eight central on animal planet you wonder why animals are the way they are you belong with us here on dnews so subscribe down there and then check out this video from the set and why some birds can't fly thanks to DNA studies we now know that all of today's flightless birds came from ancestors that flew but they all independently evolved to lose their ability to fly you wanna know something else about animals and why they are the way they are let us know in the comments keep coming back here every day so you get more yeah

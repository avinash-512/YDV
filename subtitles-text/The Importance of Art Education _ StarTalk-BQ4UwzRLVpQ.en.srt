there's a big issue probably in other places in the world but we feel it a lot here in the states that funding for arts education is always under stress and that school boards are wondering do we cut the art do we keep the science and there's tension we know this and I brought it up with David Byrne and he had strong views on that as well let's check it out in order to really succeed in whatever math and the sciences and engineering I said you have to be able to think outside of the box and you have to be creative problem solving in the the way those disciplines are taught is not big totally creative the creative thinking on at all not at all it's more like this is this this is this this is this the creative thinking is in the arts a certain amount of arts education doesn't mean that your your ambition is to grow up to be a painter but you can use that kind of thinking and apply it to anything else business engineering and be better at it and you better at that you succeed more and you bring more to the world because you have these abilities that came from outside of your discipline so bringing different worlds together has definite tangible benefits in to kind of cut one or separate them is to injure them and and cripple them you know I I basically agree with everything he said in these interviews I mean I just he is he's a deep thinker he's he's educated and so his thoughts or to put together in ways that really resonated with me when I think of culture what I think I think if you visit other countries and then they show you what it is that makes them them and not you and in almost every case you do this you are looking at their art you're looking at their architecture you are looking at aspects of their civilization that has been empowered by science and engineering and so for anyone to say let us cut art for anything else suppose they did that back in Renaissance Europe what would what would your be without the support and interest in a thriving culture of art as we readily spend money to visit the city's and go to their museums to turn around and say now going to cut the art budget here that makes no sense to me and it may be that science and art which we know sort of go together the Arts and Sciences our colleges of institutions it may be that art and science thought of in that way are the only true things that we create that lasts beyond ourselves everything else comes and goes the leaders the politics the economy's so am I biased i don't know what I do know is if there is a country without art that's not a country I want to live in there is a country without science you're living in a cave we measure the success of a civilization by how much by how well they treat their creative people

we get to know real talk i just watched the episode 13 of wicked tuna this year and what a nail-biter it's time now for we can tune a real talk show where each week after every episode of wicked tuna the captain's come on in and give us a little bit more insight into what just happened my name is mike sulka be your host joining us now are the three captains who ended the week in the top three spots on the leaderboard the fleet's current leader captain Dave Marciano the hard merchandise in second place its captain Dave Carraro fishing vessel tuna.com and right behind them in third place captain TJ ott of Hot Tuna great to have all three guys here once again there's a ton to talk about from this episode i think a great place to start is the team that has now emerged as the boat to beat hard merchandise started out the weekend third place but after an amazing trip or Marciano and Jay caught three tuna the guys jumped in the first place ahead of last season's champion fishing vessel tuna.com Marciano you guys did not start fast and it looked like it was going to be yet another year of you guys trying to play catch-up and yet here you are leading the fleet week 13 not too much time left what turned your season around yeah i don't know i mean a I go back to life said always before a little bit of luck goes a long way in this business you know we do the same thing we've always done we get out there we fish and we had some luck you know namely to like that double we had doubleheader you know the fish state of pot head they swim together we could have lost them both and just like that we could have went from three fish to one fish a little bit of luck the fish spread out we did good 13 fish in the last nine weeks semester good i got here on a pretty darn that role now you always say hey I'm just here to feed my family and I just want to make sure joke and go through college and then we hear it over no real exam refrain from you but well pride when I was younger more than just the feed his family you want to be in that top spot I mean is there some kind of place Dave how off it is it you know it's better with each our winches wash with is it we you're behind by boat your power is always behind only does he play so if i can't get heavy with speed i'll get a heavier one way or another all I have to have two words one blank believable or ok i believe is that your hard work and dedication is paid off I don't think its lucky I think you just fishing for nobody's out there on the meeting and he's taking advantage of the bites i did actually get out of the chair this trip so I must do the work and pressure on her why use this word with you all the time Dave motivation i know you're motivated certainly by competition what is the motivation like when you see Marciano on the top of the besides my eye twitch in my limited right now I'm more motivated now than I've ever been I mean I mean I would never I would never thought i would i would never guess in a in 10 seasons gave you you blew everyone else out of the water last year when it wasn't even close you won going away how different is it now with everybody right on your heels and right with you being part of the pack every year is different last year that was just simply not a lot of fish around and we were just able to capitalize on every fish that came under the boat every bite we were able to catch the majority of the fish you know we did a good job last year you know what the amount of fish that were there and that was it was very limited this year there's a lot of fish around there's more fish around this year than we've seen in many years and I think we all agree on that studies can catch it's just better here it's it's it's anybody's game you know right place right time the fish are biting their aggressive and you know who ever really puts into those time and makes all the right moves is going to be on top how much more comfortable are you on top and supposed to fighting together have a lot more comfortable on top okay i don't think anybody likes being second third and fourth you know just that it's it's more stressful and when it's more stressful usually don't perform the way you would like to TJ for the opportunity you showed up here a couple years ago with with big expectations and now you find yourself writing the chase to actually win this thing to share how how important that be for you and your crew it be huge i mean you know where there were competing right there to the end and we love to beat these guys but you know I I thought I've got to complete the black but I know how to beat the sausage weighing over are you better tell Jake another name for the boat we gonna dump the ugly duckling it was just such wagon I don't like that one play like a sausage we're gonna make you happy there's sausage flag you could put up there with the other you have to work on we don't have that yet the American flag the Italian swaggin you got the Harvard today's flight you need a big sausage you know the people . the sausage don't like forest himself why why do you think that you three have been as successful as you are this year teacher we just put in the time that's really what it comes down there the fishings good to Fisher there and it's gonna come down to the guy who puts in the most time and really gets you know lucky and Lance those fishermen that's what it boils down to day we saw you and Jay fighting to tuna at the same time this week which is a challenge in and of itself but it actually went beyond that because you actually had a tuna hanging off the back of the boat at the same time just to add another little challenge you've got the old boat the sauce & Dragons the other duckling you got you and Jay only two of you on the boat you got another one hanging off the back let's see how they handled it mark 111 up I yeah like eight rather dad me got it Ron this is as good as it oh come on now we got you are now again you must to grab it just as I started really now the tricky part is gonna be getting both aboard the boat taking out of gear running the wrong way okay I'm gonna lose it this on a bit not only do we have to fish on we've still got one fish hanging on the side we could lose one of these fish were biting getting tangled around his guilt place the only do side of his guilt and off to the basket a fighting jewfish is a double-edged sword it's a great thing you got to one that's cool but if those lines cross we could lose them both have here it's chaos we're gonna have to fight these fish opposite sides of the boat to fish on 80 it's going to reduce the likelihood of those lines crossing black slacks lakh every one of these we get close to deal with fresh all right so it looks like you could lose both of your fish air Marciano what are you gonna do you got two on the line and you've got one hanging off the back of the boat how stressful is that for you and Jack yeah it's it's stressful but you know it's only a matter we gotta take some action right i mean that was good fishing we didn't even have a chance to get the one in the boat we were on again we got them up on the side we get him out of the way so we could fight the other two fish do we made it happen where the dollars you got too much and that's where i got experience he cums in you know the kids been on the boat a long time not he did great driving the boat he did great fighting fish that's a tough act for anybody to juggle the day what's the key to that was the key to realign into fish at the same time and we collectively work together you know you have to I mean like you said he had the two fish on he had to fish hanging and I've seen it before the one fish runs underneath the fish thats hanging and as it's running it cause it right off you lose one fish and then you break the other one off and you guys did everything you needed to win you gotta work together and you don't even bump j off the wheel like Tyler did I didn't have to the kid was doing good how often would you say that happens that you get to the same at the same time many Paul and I we've and Sandra we've had four on at times before pay it does happen it was shy but everything again that this pros and cons to it you know again you put happen for on is great but really it's tough to land all for what is the probability rate on something like that once you get what you say to a moron to the little you know high probability of losing you have 50 under the boat you know you might get a double well over on the Hot Tuna TJ your beef last week with Dave on the.com was still fresh in your mind clearly was a big motivating factor for you and hot to a team all this week let's take a look see the blackboard always down there the hot zone is currently number two on the leaderboard and dot-coms in the lead thanks to us last week Dave lights once we put them onto a hotspot anybody except that way to sit and no one told us fishing was slow but he actually caught three fish and raped in 14 grand well yeah crowd fortuna while causing us to miss out on the bike that's a pretty low ball moving forward he's out of my network out of my circle of trust now all these to me as competition nothing else it's also a our goal to make sure we out fish Dave itj the the so-called bad blood between you and David it seemed to really motivate you and really give you a little bit of extra fuel to the fire this week how how motivated are you by what had happened the week earlier with dave well I mean I want to win this thing obviously I want to beat these guys but that definitely added fuel to the fire for sure you saw him lose a fish early in the week the dot-com guys saw you catch a fish fairly early as well and dave says he feels curse now this kind of goes against the the day view of luck where he doesn't believe in Lock how could you feel cursed there i don't know maybe karma got comin together in which doctor was a good day from your side of things TJ really seem to be gunning for you this week how's that make you feel that everything regardless of what happened last week everybody's always gonna be gunning for you especially if you're on top everybody's got their balls on everybody wants to be that boat that's just part efficient the top guy everybody wants that top guys hated . Marciano you are that top guy right now and you weren't here last week as we got to really explore in-depth what happened with the with the other two character sit next to you but what do you make of it how how how off how common or disagreements with other fishermen how big a deal are it's not a big deal look it happens we're all under a lot of stress we all want to catch the most fish the fish worth money as much as we try and get along and be great buddies right when it comes down to an out fishing I want to do better than Dave Dave wants to do better than me and TJ what's new better than both of us that's what we really feel like it's you know as much as we like to say hey it's great you all got them too when it really comes down to it you know humans in general we were a little bit selfish in nature like that right that's just how we are so arguments how often do you find that it's difficult to swallow your pride and just say look I'm sorry let's move on more often than i would like you know everything right I have to say I'm sorry all the time from you know I wish I could say I was perfect but you know no one here is we all make mistakes and you know hopefully we don't think we've seen it where all of us you know we we pick up the pieces we say we're sorry we move on wee man up and move on you not to say that to jail do now Jason difference at all right he's just a crewmember yeah he's sorry however it's not like he's a real person or something has come along way you doing great i think he has no yeah it's really don't tell you without a doubt i mean again he earned his keep you know just this trip with those two fish he did everything right you did and think about it you guys had also time he's yelling and screaming that's one fish you had three on anybody said two words alright alright every season we just see a little glimpse into the type of food that you guys prepare when you're out on the water waiting for by each boat a little bit different we've seen jeon hard merchandise eat straight out of a can that was unimpressive and two weeks ago my god prepared would look like a gourmet meal for the Hot Tuna guys this week . com was cooking sausages that rolled around in the rocky rocky sees Adam from the sausage bill is that where you could just all the matter is also have done it lose the bet what's the best what's the best boat to go to for good food DJ I don't know man I mean I i like the way to tell you but I thought of you know that I I got you know but I tell you the best thing I i finally yeah there's someone gives a piece of fresh halibut or something that will break it up and what we do it if someone eats food they could come to us we'll come up we've been on your bill . yeah he's gonna get for he's got he's got all the amenities now Dean you know on the other hand when he's cooking his dinner that starts at five o'clock morning but hot canned food on his exhaust manifold that's ready by 5pm you have room on your boat to cook anything no we don't ever don't ever look we get a grill once in awhile if it's common got the grill but if it's too rough to kohls just get put out by the wave so everybody just don't eat well on your body we can whether it's in the can it's good it's rolls doesn't do you cook it on a manifold what you can do when you look for the bus heat and find another name i get open the engine hatch to do that let's work you guys have worked on a boat what if 402 now the onions the jungle when we have one for you have to share the war and it by allocate one for the season you may say feed it to her i buy fresh blocks and you get one for the season to get 14 can get one spoon you think that like having Mike on the boat has made your boat more successful this year I I think he's coming out of the fog yeah he started out rusty but I think he's definitely been asked that I just moved from the eating perspecto yeah well I'm crew is a high cholesterol is going up a bunch of points and food is here for the crew but now it sits at the end of the day when everyone's got a job and when you're tired you just wanna have a hot meal or just kind of you know relax a little bit it's nice to have somebody doing that for you and you don't have to do it you know Dave who cooks on your boat anyway all take chance we all take turns doing any mailman was great to have on the boat now then used to love cooking breakfast lunch and dinner but you know what's on your mind George will make one good meal a day and that's typically at night but they can't wait all day for that we have a week during the day but it's usually cold foods you know no fish no fish no you're cooking fish on your benefit no fish on anyhow they can even fish you just don't like it I don't eat fish I just catch him Marciano when you guys are out there what kind of food do you and Jake prepare for yourselves Tom you know normally we have a grill right if it's come out we'll cook on the grill maybe some sausages some hamburgers but that being said it's not often that comment up we cook on the grill so we threw a couple of canned goods and for the bus heater or even write out the cat is good enough for me TJ for people haven't lived out on the open water like that what what is the what is the quality of life living on the ocean for a period of days or a week to spoil my ring I'm not gonna sugarcoat imagine you are you know we have freezers refrigerators and ovens and TV sat TV yeah it really is built to travel you know long distances and Marcia more for you then because you're the one who's out there without a lot of those creature comforts what is what was that experience like okay it's like it's like Captain it really is it's like camping and you know what those calm nights when we can start the grill once in awhile even have a bag of marshmallows to roast over oh yeah holes would done right I mean that's how Jay and I look at it we get in we don't have a shower we can open up for five days it's five days with no shower I mean we just it's camping it's rough it but you know when I didn't look good but there to catch fish if you come over us will share with you i know you've just in the past TJ you focus ya know TJ is very generous when they head back sure and Brittany regenerate he's he's made us to make sandwiches for breakfast sometimes look at one more curious about the shower thing when you guys talking about now I'd never given him a shower i mean i just grabbed himself has her while the fleet has been fishing it now for more than three months this week marked the beginning of the countdown to the end now there are only two weeks left until the season closes guys you've all been there especially this time of the year I mean it's a long way into the season when your body is as exhausted as it can be and you've been out and just as grueling as it can be what keeps you going this is it i mean is when the bottom of the ninth-inning they'll know the score is basically tied you know we're not going to give up everybody wants to hit that last home run it's it's almost over to and you know to an efficient is like banging your head against the wall  it feels great when you stop when you can look at this stuff look it's going to be incredibly tense what do you see happening down the stretch marciana you got that you got the lead now you gotta try to protect it I want to hang onto it that's so which was thinking you know something about that I don't know how I'm gonna go see the Italian witch doctor and put a curse on you and put you right out of the game for the rest of did I know you're motivated what do you need to do to get back out there in the last couple of weeks and get in front of Marciano gonna go out there and pound it out and say we're going to do the same thing we do every TJ I'm just going to pray for the best man well the Robins that we can actually capitalizing land yeah no more rubber hooks in the meantime keeping whatever might make whatever bubble only put the front is a good chance disappears could get at the end of that sucker all right well that's all the time that we have for this week wanna give you guys

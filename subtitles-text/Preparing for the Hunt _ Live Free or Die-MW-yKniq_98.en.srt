it's the final week of deer hunting season and frontiersmen Colbert its last chance to get big game before winter it's important to clean your weapon I don't have any gonna roll with me but I've got pig fat and pig that's gonna work just fine since leaving a domestic life in the suburbs 25 years ago kolberg depends on himself to get food and one deer is about 70 pounds of meat before i go huntin operate the rifle make sure it mechanically works fine and make sure the sites are properly adjusted I'm out there and I got it dear insights and it doesn't work I don't get any meat the average person out there had to fight for the food to the winter down the swamp and go hungry if they missed they would get a rude awakening if they didn't die first that's about the right size for a deer herd right there a lot of my friends tell me when I get old I'm gonna have to figure out another plan to find me a safe place to be in the city or suburb or somewhere but there's just no way I can do that  it's not gonna happen my idea is to live the way people did thousands of years ago living off the land until I pass well that's some good hits here's my dear heart it looks like it left the animal it was right there there's a bullet hole I'd say that site in

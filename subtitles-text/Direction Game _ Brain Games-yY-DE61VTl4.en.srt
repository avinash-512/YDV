it's time to look at one of the most important brain functions of all memory of course to get to our next location will need directions so let's play a direction game here's a simple memory test pay attention to the directions we give you between the British Museum and Buckingham Palace there are multiple routes but remember the specific route we point out we're going to ask you about it later here we go from the museum and make a left onto bloomsbury way hang a right at kingsway make a left on Aldwych make a right onto the strand now at the roundabout in Trafalgar Square take the 3rd exit straight through on to the mall and at the end of the mall that's Buckingham Palace straight ahead ok let's see if you were paying attention do you turn left or right onto if you said left you are correct do you turn right or left onto kingsway if you said right you are correct what street after King's way do you turn on you said Aldwych you are correct after all the witch what's the roadway you turn right on if you said the Strand you are correct and finally at the roundabout which exit do you take if you said the third exit you are correct did you get them all right that's great you probably have a really good memory did you get most of those wrong if so don't feel bad it takes London cab drivers years before they are able to remember those

there's the traditional magic trick opposing the rabbit out of a hat and these and card tricks and generally we think of our attention being sort of misdirected rather than there being an illusion and Susanna tell me about the kinds of misdirection that exists but we tend to think that would magicians though is they distract us from the phase that they don't want to see and and this is not correct with magicians rather than the structure with magicians do is they're extremely good at directing your attention to the place and the moments in time where they wanted to be paying attention to and then your brain will bridge the magicians best accomplish because whenever you're paying attention to something your brain just depresses everything else paying attention is not enhancing what you're paying attention to is blocking everything else that is not relevant it's quite a show and of course teller doesn't speak in my interview here nor does he speak onstage and so I just had to complement the show that I saw I was very impressed and I seen them on TV and it's got to be in real life to really believe the allusion to see what what's what's really goin down so I I gave him you know I complimented them on their work in the to see their reaction he is so good you are you are so I can talk to him is what you're so good with your body language in your facial expressions we all knew exactly what you were thinking and saying or at least wanted us to think you were thinking with the idea of being able to live without speaking you know one of the things you learn most in magic there's no better live than lawyer tell yourselves now in Vegas we only show with the bullet catch which is seen that done on a cruise ship well because it in your teeth you don't but that's what looks like a more complex when this is behind a glass and the other side of the table that is signed it in a way that it is true that breaks the glass and he recalls his head and pulled it out in there it is and it has it's a it's it's an interesting trip because at least 15 people have died on stage doing the most dangerous trick it in show business really and we do a version that we believe is safe we would not do it because it would be immoral to do it if it were not safe but the bullet catch now if I say to you you know we're gonna catch a bulletin or teeth you saying no you're not of course so we never ever say we're gonna catch a ball in our teeth we're gonna move the bullet from this side of the stage to that side of the stage using this magic want holding up a god now what you do is you don't give the audience a sentence had taken saying no to and let them fill in the blanks so after the show they say that you caught the ball in your teeth is great but I never said it so when you say something so when telander doesn't speak onstage and he just allows you to make all these assumptions he is functioning as he's fooling you with lies you're telling yourself

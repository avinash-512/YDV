I wanna talk to you a little bit about friction fire the tools that you need are you need your hearth board a spindle and you also need a nest with a nest I like to start out with the my longer fibers I'll just twist those around form a little bit of a pocket with the tenderness you want everything pretty tight so it the spindle and heart wants something fairly light but most important it's the grain structure if you look at this one you would see little grains almost little holes and pours in here so you want to make a starter hole so I make it did in there you can sit on your butt like this or another technique that helps you get it up on above that either on both knees or one can sometimes for a little bit more weight on the starter hole just want to get that . or just start smoking so the notch basically i start by cutting at the top so i can see it is basically like cutting out a piece of pie what it's doing is allowing the pump to accumulate one spot once you have that prepared you want something to catch the cold like this wood chipper relief or something set it down nice and secure we want you ready and make sure your hands have enough friction on the spindle either spit on it or if if you run out spit you can have a little bit of water nearby road that your hands the key is you're putting a lot more pressure on it so i'm actually pushing really hard inward and downward same time that that driving force what's going to use the pole so as you're going once you see that basically have smoke coming out of out of the pile of punk at that point you can stop Tapani leftover punk on it keep building you can see it's it's red higher drop the cool in the seems counterintuitive but you want to squeeze that nest you really create a lot Cole way down in there deep breath you want to increase the breath hardness as it starts spreading that's it you want to turn it on its side towards the wind you had a fire that's it that's that's friction fire in a nutshell right there

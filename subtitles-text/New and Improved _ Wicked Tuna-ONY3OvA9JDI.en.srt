this is it boys let's make it happen it's the first day of the season and I could not be more excited nothing stopping us this year and we are going on a warpath we're going to mean we've got to get it done mean is where all the betas and that's why these bluefin tuna go there to feed and to fatten up from Gloucester it's an 80-mile trip to maine waters it's a big gamble we're going to burn some fuel but no risk no reward got to be in the right place at the right time that's not luck last year we were not on top but this year we built the new tuna.com it's definitely the best to vote out there right now I gotta catch fish in order for me to keep this boat otherwise i can go belly-up rockero do this Sandra is going to be my guy and I'm gonna have Georgie as my deck and we're here to prove that we can be a number one boat in the fleet . put her head down the grindstone they dialed and stay out and get it done seasons on let's get it done this boat will be on top again this year you can count on that I bluefin do we call baby it's gonna be extremely competitive this year we want to win this there's no sitting at the dock there's no playing games we've been kinda middle-of-the-pack guys and we don't want to finish in the middle of fleeting more we're just gonna have to grind my ride this year more than any other year I really feel like I need to prove that was the one of the best both in this class to flee what do you think huh you're ready rebel gotta stick to our game at the end of the season I know it's gonna put us at the top there's a lot of stake for us the guys need to make money we're going for first season drop the anchor we already two minutes i'm 80 a lot riding on this season last year we had a really good year put on a fish made a lot of Marciano beat us out there at the end really hungry I want to be the winner I want to be the number one bone loss for that's what it's all about the last two seasons i haven't been able to keep a consistent crew from one year to the next and a lot of the fleet just criticize my leadership because of it but this season i finally have a salty made on board take the stick and clean it off to the wheelhouse whatever I'm really stoked to have on the boat I think you can help me catch a lot of fish I got a lot of work to do and I'm really counting on Drake to help me get to the top I'm 19 years old but I've been fishing for bluefin since I was 12 Tyler reached out to me to come fishing this year and I think he did that because he knows i can get the job done he knows what I expect from eight this season and he can deliver so I'm confident that we're going to be a force to be reckoned let go yeah

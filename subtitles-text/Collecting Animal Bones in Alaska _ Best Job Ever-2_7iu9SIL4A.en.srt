so here we are on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge we're here looking for caribou antlers and bones we are pretty much finding bones wherever we go we have here is a shed full caribou antler so I'm a large male this is where it attaches to the skull and these two points are these two ends rather have been cut by humans with interesting about that is that this and we're judging by the weathering is probably a few hundred years old that looks like we have a real long-term record of human caribou interactions what we're doing with all these bones is trying to put together a picture of what this ecosystem was like centuries to thousands of years ago the Arctic refuge is an amazing place gorgeous landscapes incredible wildlife doing beautiful rivers to flow past but it has some challenges including an epic number of frogs here they're landing on the Arkham and Wildlife Refuge friends yeah this field work is hard weather is bad often the bugs are horrendous the food is pretty darn lousy life . the excitement we have of getting out of our tents that and finding the bones that are out there it drives us we're finding things that have never been seen before and it's incredibly exciting looking good yeah we like it here approximately 2,000 beluga whales come here every summer to Walter skin socialize raise their young and just below the party

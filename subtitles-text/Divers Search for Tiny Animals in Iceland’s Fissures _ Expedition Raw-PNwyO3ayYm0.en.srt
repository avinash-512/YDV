I used to think there was nothing left to be found I'm realizing that we're really just scratching the surface of what is really hear the first time I did a picture I almost wanted to drop my regulator I didn't expect anything that beautiful to exist no other team has ever studied the biology or the ecology of underground Fisher's when we dive in the fisher were carrying around 40 kilos of equipments the strenuous access can make it very very risky we're creating a sip line to gain better access to the water it's a little bit steep over there so we want to be very careful but sometimes we just have to jump you get this powerful brain freeze when you first come into the fisher the very crystal clear waters at that giveaway that there's not much living in the water column if you look closer you'll start seeing that there are in fact thousands of animals there's many different habitats within one Fisher we have species living here which can't be found anywhere else in the world we vacuumed the biological material of the war bring it to the surface as we're collecting samples to take back to the lab so far we've made some exciting discoveries like a copepod species no one knew existed in Iceland film i'll have to take it to the lab go through the whole sample i really like combining these two passions of mine the diving in the science get over that we're going to be in open water

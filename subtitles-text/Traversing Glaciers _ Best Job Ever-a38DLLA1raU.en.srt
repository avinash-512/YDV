most of these glaciers are declining someone has to go out there and really show what's happening to those climate changes here now me and Coleman schoolyard we're going to cross all the 20 biggest glaciers in the world we always try to have some fun and this trips and we're always competing a little bit one time we come to this slope and just writes that is that crack whore some going down this low so as good son yeah oh yeah I'm the old guy in 52 since the young guy is 28 that's all that's what this expedition is really about knowledge transferring the moment the alter the nature of the younger generation i did a lot of the solar trips and just out there by yourself and everything is so extreme so I'm really glad minsan i decided to do this project together because tools can achieve a lot more than just one person thanks for the feedback works

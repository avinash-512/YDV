I think there's been a big trend in expeditions that are geared towards science that's also geared towards conservation I can rationalize you know why I take risks for scientific reasons for conservation reasons but I would be lying to you it's just amazing to get into these places I'd ready to get after some of these trips what why do you keep going on these sorts of expeditions why you keep going on them and it's cliche but this is why we going then we go to these amazing places from aesthetic and cultural standpoint and I got to go all around the world i used to work as in commercial diving so i was sent to remote areas what sort of my specialty it's just you realize that we're living in a different kind of world and you're just drawn into them and then all of a sudden you're jerked out of that world and you end up you know like and the irony of this this particular accident which is I had been diving all day and one of the deepest known caves in the world 663 feet deep and we're doing with what objectively is pretty risky diving and after three days of working in this hole in the Bahamas I climbed up on the roof of a three-story building and take a picture of a rare tree that was blooming and I fell off the roof so you know our objective vs subjective risk assessment is not you know not so great in the beginning I was motivated by adventure I wasn't motivated by these more rational excuses and I was never kind of analytically motivated as a child you can see I think that's my high school report card yeah so my analytical skills were somewhat a under underdeveloped to put it in my sleep do you think that's for kids in the audience hey come talk to me after but I was motivated by other things and actually that's that's the real cover from 2015 issue that i just found out before the show that was one of the top selling off the shelf covers my only explanation is that I think the stoners must've kept buying it oh I didn't remember that they bought it well anyway but i was i was very much motivated by the ocean and surfing and I i actually tried to get into the Navy and the Coast Guard and I kept doing the psychological tests and it's it unfit for vertical chain of command it's like kind of stuck in my head but I didn't up going to school in California on and off it and UC Santa Barbara mostly motivated by the surfing but I was really into the ocean in anything to do with adventure I end up getting jobs in the film industry doing stunts in coordinating stunts and and that you know I found out wow you can make a living off of adventure but it was once i started getting into the diving that's what opened up really the world of science to me you go into this in significant tiny little muddy hole and you realize beneath my feet is this whole other world that's unexplored and kind of my realization of this in the increase in some of my diving skills coincide with me with meeting West Skiles and he really guided me as as a mentor as a friend when I was 19 years old into what the the world of professional diving was like and he was the photographer on our expedition to the blue holes of the Bahamas that was a cover story in august of 2010 and that's the shot you can see there's four divers and that picture actually and west in this tragic irony he died just a few days before the magazine with his cover shot came out and it was devastating to all of us but it's to me being up here is very much she'll also telling my friend stories and it's not just Wes who passed away in expedition related activities it hits close to home as well this was from one of my I have a little boys names Lincoln and this was in kindergarten that is not his handwriting it's like a free association i guess so when he came up with sad it kind of rubs your nose in it you know it hits home and it's just this battle in my own brain of what's worth it what's not and everyone so I'll just gets too much and then at some point you know 20 years ago I went back to school because I felt like okay I need something more substantial career i'm very interested in the sciences mix of ecology along with on with human behavior and that's how I ended up in environmental anthropology and i was i was only in school for less than two semesters when I get this letter in the mail from some of you may know dr. bill stone who's an explorer and an innovator inviting me to join the United States deep caving team and this is where we went so in southern Mexico in Oaxaca in the what's called the wildlife plateau and we all drove there independently and we're set to meet a certain date was pre gps so actually that's the map that we were given and saying where to go you know don't be late bring your money but you know we're driving through the lowland jungle and you come around the corner and this is what you see this massively this uplifted limestone plateau in the cave entrance we're going to work on was at the top of this plateau and that's the view from the cave entrance in the mouth of the cave is quite small but it creates a giant microclimate because of different temperatures and pressures this is the entrance so you drop down I think you can see the person and so here's the the cave system so you have the jungle drop i just mentioned you start doing day trips where you're dropping all the equipment you're dragging everything by rope it's a very vertical cave and when you have enough equipment at the depot you stop taking day trips and you start living underground so camp 3 was our main base camp camp fives where we would start the diving but you can only send two people at a time to camp five because the area is really small and you're hanging over the water so most of the activity was a camp three and you're going down and down and you know some of these drops are a few hundred meters really you're confined to the dark and you're stuck with people some of whom you really love in some of whom well you know and then from there you really keep going down and keep going down and you go through these canyons that are just amazing of crystal clear water you get - roaring waterfalls and you can't even hear yourself think and in fact camp five was at one of these roaring waterfalls and so we used to wear balaclavas and earplugs and i ended up down at Camp five with my very good friend in rowland and he he and i were kind of the team pranksters sorry and I really teamed up and we were the two youngest and we really got along very well so when we were down there was our turn we were lower on the totem pole to to get a chance to dive in the other team the other team members haven't had luck at cracking the some cracking this underwater passageways full of some tight restrictions and you can't see more than about really about what some in front of your hand and so I got to die first and I went on this is this gives you a good sense and machine it's too redundant rebreathers that you're wearing on your back there's about ten valves that you're constantly changing there's two computers that you're constantly monitoring and changing so it was a complex very experimental system at the time and then you're also doing all the cave diving which is running a constant guideline tons of other caving related so in and I were down there and it was really the probably that time was the most fun I've ever had in my life everything was going like clockwork we've been working together for two or three months we traded jokes we didn't even have to finish each others sentences I mean we were quite close and I made it pretty far on the first time I got through what had been apparently stopping people and made it far came back excited we fix up the rebreather because we were sharing one rebreather and then he and took off and he made it a little bit further and he said I i think it might be sloping up and then came back and then I went and I actually made it all the way through the something came up into a big air bell with a big giant sand bar and I literally felt like I was on another planet had this otherworldly feelings otherworldly silence and I was so excited and ian was a better dry caper than me so I want to get back it was you know a little less than a half a mile swim back so i made it back to camp five and i think this is it we did it and even took off on the next dive and he took off I remember he had his helmet he had his kids teddy bear taped onto his helmet I rapped on to his helmet and you know we had it said if he's not back in six hours you know the literally the words were called the cavalry and two hours go by was expecting in about three or four hours five hours six hours and no end so I you know I left the pot of hot pot of tea a light of pulley system so you could get yourself out of the water and I headed back a few hours up to camp 3 i got there about one in the morning and woke everyone up and said we have to go on a rescue and it was probably one of the most experience with this machine and but he also was a diabetic so there was a question in my mind was having some kind of diabetic incident and I got into quite a fight with a team but to make a very very long horrific story short I ended up going back down making the dive and found Ian's on the other side of the sandbar back in the water where he had started diving again with a cave diving real with a line in his hand and I found him at the bottom with just the real right out of his very peacefully so it was you know all of a sudden to go from the highest high to the lowest low you can imagine in about the lowest point you can ever literally was was devastating and you have to block that out of your mind and i made the my way back to camp five where Bill was waiting for me and it took six days to get in and back out to the surface and ends up i was ended up being underground for 21 days and that's what it looks like after 21 days underground but when we came out and we came out with the ends body the mazda tech village and I'll never forget this and i'm still forever grateful they had carved out steps in the cornfields and the whole village came in accompanied us out and we went right into the the local small Cathedral where we it was a really a combination of an indigenous religion along with Catholicism and had an extremely moving ceremony right there and there it was I don't want to tell you that was get the idea but for me I was I don't even know I hadn't slept for days and days and ended up the National Geographic film team with my friend Wes had just gotten down there a couple days before and somehow we decided to go back into the K for a few days and just kind of try to get a grip on things we got caught in a flash flood and end up getting trapped for four days ripped all of our ringing we have having to ration food and lighting stuff by the way if you ever are short on things and after rash and don't tell anyone your rationing it just it's like creates instant hoarders but we know what we got out of there and at the end of that I was really I was done and I left the expedition and Bill was very gracious and in that in fact most of the expedition was gone but bill and Barbara him and was one of the leaders on the she and Bill decided to go on and they did what was in my opinion one of the most audacious exploration feet so he and i had stopped at that deepest point they went by themselves all the way to that for this point which at the time was the deepest point known and there was no chance of anyone ever rescuing them that's them at the the deepest point right there and this was in the nineteen ninety-five issue of national geographic and here's a picture of my friend again and you know I kept in touch with his family over the years and his wife remarried someone from the same mountain rescue team but this is that his two-year-old Connor now who's become a British cave or a very well-known British paver and we hadn't met for he's now 24 years old and he came to Florida two weeks ago so we spent 10 days together traveling around Florida diving together so I mean it's hard it is for me to tell this story it's kind of in a strange way it's come full circle and it was we had a really great great time we're heading down to explore an underwater cave and then all of a sudden it just started raining down on harmony my initial reaction was to just going to scream in my

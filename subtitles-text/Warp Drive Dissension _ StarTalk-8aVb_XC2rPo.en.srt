the truck had some science and I thought or suicides that had yet to come that we have now in some other signs we know we never get right like i like the warp-drive who doesn't like who doesn't right there without let me confess publicly right now i have described the warp-drive incorrectly in my past oh that's what I can't walk this condition ok I when I first knew of the warp drive from the original series i think all the warping space just like I would fold this piece of paper just you're trying to get across the galaxy which is a hundred thousand light-years across if it's our Milky Way and you actually walk in space like that is so wrong but I don't have you back for your prize with a subspace field and honest and evaluation license how long I was so so you work the space and then you travel to a little wormhole across and then don't unfold it and then you get across the galaxy during the TV commercial and it would take a hundred thousand years can get so then so so people must have been Tim because i think i was saying that for years and until something like that som I was a comic own and some Star Trek people met me in an alley and there they had the woods at the lab with that weapon that the that to that leg yeah that's the big one the necklace is a little one yeah but wow tell me how the world works what happens is that the warp nacelles create a subspace field around the ship which allows it then to slide through ordinary space faster than light ok so the war factors is how fast you're able to slide through this subspace so how are they working it's a complete fabrication well he's mine had yours has high like this you your time on this is real the warp thing is a bubble toil describing something is real so-and-so our car so I was long about the show yes I I beg forgiveness but you look good doing it but if we ever going to warp space it's going to be something like this maybe maybe what if we yeah I mean yeah what if we use quantum wave technology quantum wave or quantum teleportation whatever I'm down with that ok we'll do a whole show with that the point is that the idea that we can bend space easier than we can bend ourselves seems to me backwards but that's just the physicist and me what do I

I think that every generation experiences the natural world differently like the fifties and sixties like this glorified like Yellowstone go see the bear maybe drying like my parents generation the park system was sort of blooming and emerging whereas now it's a bit more in place the last generation was more like take the whole family in the camper van and spend a week in Yellowstone my dad always took us camping i went a lot of places when I was in a stroller I visit Yellowstone we went to a lot of national park did a lot of camping so I'm grace I don't really remember any of it we should actually go to Joshua Tree all ok that I was like eight years old I think that I cried the whole time I was like change I mean I never grew up in a in a family or anything like that where that we went out and kind of explore that much I used to like outdoor but I didn't have any opportunities to do anything other than biking that old I've never seen the mountains before I've never been past Illinois the way national parks were developed for visitation is that they were made for automobile driving driving through other couples and their way that is in the light you know judgment always like an easy we have usually been the youngest people is definitely the older crowd is still here people who have been dirtbag it before i was bored so we do get a lot of use from places like China sometimes even France Germany that come here and they usually seem pretty excited people in my generation yet they may experience national parks a little differently I think it's more active 41 our generation it's more like just kind of scattershot let's go our generation definitely appreciate beautiful places i think our generation is getting out there a lot more my family and friends they thought i was crazy my family has really followed me into the outdoors people who are starting to actually get out in the backcountry it seems to me that there's definitely been a push toward being on the nature more I mean every time we go to keep the Loon camp it's full and majorities young people so yeah I mean I think I'd energy definitely comes I feel like most of my generation is moving to the city find like way more value and importance and getting out of the city to you know there's not like this little girl looks bored away from the busy la like actually like was deep into the freelance photography trying to have passion going on with all the los angeles i was living in venice beach i'm working in fashion started to ring all away after a long and just hit the brakes think I was like absolutely not i'm going to zion i should say that we don't take it for granted there's a lot of Millennials that are criminalized student debt so a lot of times I think it is difficult for people to leave their jobs you can always come back to the city there's you know it's always there waiting for you . with john muir think about right what would he think about the paved rose and all the people out here seeing and appreciating it and I honestly think that he would be excited that so many people it's so excited about nature i'm so happy I think that my kids are gonna be like mad mom you guys just took off in your fans you'll quit your job the different way that we're experiencing parks is that we're doing in a more interactive ways that will pull tweetable Instagram it used google maps to find all sorts of parks to go camping in your bb and you can go look at trails top of maps you know I use a burning apps to to identify birth it's easier than ever the question is where is the line there's always this debate of people are like how much you actually looking at what you're even though they're in nature they're seeing it still through a screen

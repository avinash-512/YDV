I think people conflate two different things here when they talk about the moving frontier of space exploration if you can advance a space frontier you have gone farther than any one has gone before to me that's advancing a space frontier anything else could be an engineering frontier and of course there's overlap between the two so SpaceX launched into orbit came back and landed that's great but we've never done that before now we ask who is going to advance the space frontier the history of this exercise a high risk with little promise of economic return for doing at first the history that exercise tells me that governments do it and they assign the tasks and the patent skip made and discovered to accomplish these previously untapped goals once that's quantified then you have private enterprise come in and make a buck off the first Europeans to the new world were not the Dutch East India Trading Company was columbus set by Spain spain had other objectives have a baseline of time much longer than a quarterly report or an annual report it's a clean tree countries can make those kinds of investments particularly if the long-term return on that investment is for the greater glory of the country itself i don't see SpaceX as being like the private company that's going to take us to Mars they could do it on a SpaceX rocket that's not a new thing the relationship between NASA and all the rest what would be new is if space tech said we're going to Mars and we don't need any governmental help we're gonna do this as a complete commercial exercise i just don't see that happening imagine the conversation i'm CEO of a company and I want to be the first to put a colony on Venus but I'm a private companies are bringing investors and they asked me questions they say how much does it cost I don't know but more than has ever been spent in space before ok there's a dangerous yes people will probably die what's the return on the investment i don't know probably nothing for a long time that's a really quick meeting the government can say we want to go to Venus because a strategic value possible long-term economic value that venture capitalist investors don't have the patience to wait out so I'm just trying to be practical here and the way civilizations have behaved ever since there's been

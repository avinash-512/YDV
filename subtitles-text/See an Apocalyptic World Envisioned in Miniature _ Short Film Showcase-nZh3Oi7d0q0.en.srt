I'm not the type of photography that's going to go out and find thanks to photograph i'm going to create things to photograph Kathy nine starters bodywork back in $MONTH 2005 so series called the city postulates a worldpost mankind something has happened that's a decimated the human population so these are the city after man is gone and it's just the way that buildings age and crumble and nature takes back some of the spaces and I thought just the last thing that should be would be an artist studio and what better reference do i have in my own studio even though i may be only get behind my camera three times a year and I spend more time working with my hands I'm definitely a photographer more than a sculptor I feel like I know how to make the camera live and we have to build the diorama from one . vantage point so when you go into a 360 moving around its not going behind the scenes and broadway you know behind the currents are all the mechanisms to to make it run same with the diorama if you've been to our living room you'll notice that it actually looks like the end of the world looks like a disaster a disaster scene and this model is kind of fun it's actually cleaner than our actual living room kinda sad to say we used to have a couch and then like one little table to work on get rid of the couch got a bigger table yeah people either like all the clutter and find it inspiring or it makes people really anxious and they like really can't stay here very long it's nice working within the apartment because it ends up being a real blend so do this and i'll stop maybe and go make lunch and then you know do some other house things while they paint drying something and come back if I did go somewhere I don't think I'd find it satisfying but then this is also the dining table and get out it's a double-edged sword for sure the subway was in the living room in the scene so we knew that we had to have it in the final model too so i made a replica of a replica of a subway initially I was just come in and do a little bit here and there and you know it was not either of our intention for my role to sort of grow but i like this but you were already pretty established as you and you know we need that to keep going but she gets so much grief from her mother controlling the anger haha i think for now it's kind of wound up where it started it is lori's name on the work and I'm fine with that I want to make things and you know having my name front center isn't necessarily why I want to do it so far this is only had my name on this work even though she's a huge part of it but i think from here on out if if she wants it will change the name from like Lori next to Nixon gerber ya know Mexican with October necks that's a drug company if it's small and detail-oriented Kathleen's gonna do it because she has the patience and the mindset for working small and delicate and if it's a large requires any sort of measuring and knife skills is going to be although you do have good knife skills but more for carving not for cutting yeah there's always like one thing that will buy and we scale things up around it but for this particular one we fabricated just about everything in the scene I flatbed scanner all the books in my bookshelves same with my CDs on the internet i was able to find all of like these CD covers so I typed in all the other things that i have in my collection they printed them up and then I glued to a multiplex then polish for the edges so that it looks like its actual CD case of a huge cowboy junkies fan here is Kate Bush here's a patty griffin working Bush these Laurie Laurie made they were a piece of like PVC tubing and then I was like a little washer to make it look like a pinky very resourceful we're trying to keep everything is as real as possible i messed up on the on the flat files because mine actually has five and i only made for I don't know why because they don't have clothes and yeah they open that very important for a still photograph that they believe but this little details that really make the scene come alive with the fan in the back window the power cords going everywhere little items on the on the then Kathleen created this great chair and the light and everything else I really like your brushes I think they're just great that the cans and the brushes are amazing but i thought this would be a nice way to end the series this is because we mrs. where we spend so much yeah this is where everything is created is yeah this is everything I'm too close to see the illusion have to like rely on friends to tell me whether it works or not especially with this one most people look at when they look at our you get their attention for I believe it's three seconds maybe four if you're lucky so that hopefully by making that that juxtaposition between real not real maybe they might look at the piece a little bit longer if they even get into this type of artwork it's not for everybody after I've lived with it for seven months because that's usually how long it takes us to build and then photograph then I take out what other objects might be able to be repurposed in a scene and then the rest gets broken down into small pieces put into black trash bags and taken to the curb some of the objects will find their way into the next bodywork have no problem decommissioning the studio i love throwing my scenes away because it means i'm ready to start the next scene

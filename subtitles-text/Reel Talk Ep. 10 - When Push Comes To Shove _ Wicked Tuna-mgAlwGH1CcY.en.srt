we get to know real talk you just saw the new episode of wicked tuna now it's time for we can tune a real talk with some of the best bluefin captains in the business discuss this week of fishing i'm your host microsoft good to be with you joining us this time captain Dave Marciano the hard merchandise captain Paul Cheney of drama making his first appearance captain Tyler McLaughlin of the pinwheel and captain Dave Carraro of fishing vessel tuna.com thank you all for joining us today I look lot to get to this week a lot to talk about the fleet's got a new leader one captain definitely lost his cool and maybe even his mate and one boat bout out of the competition after a nightmare nightmare season in the opening of this latest episode we saw captain Dave Carraro and deckhand Geordie Sosa rowing official fishing vessel tuna.com past hard merchandise is that how bad it's gotten let's take a look check it out . this way cooler Marciano really can't push the limits he's got the old Humpty Dumpty bow just kind of cut along and not my bow goes faster an idol Mr Sanders does at top speed those guys up to yeah Jesus guys wow dave was just goofing around he had to drive by real close to jealous that his vote is basically twice as fast as this one Marciano your boat has been the butt of jokes this season I don't know why everybody's decided this is the year to start taking shots at you but we saw Dave rolling past who they called you both hunting . they said old technology basically called you past your Prime and yet here you are in first place by the end of the episode vindication it oh yeah hey old school rules right some things you don't need to change or I it's not that I'm anti-technology but at the end of the day stuff costs money the more money you put into the boat the less money get to bring home the boats adequate it's does its job it's saved that's what's important and you know he's sure in a perfect world I'd like to have a nice fancy boat but you know what that boats mind i got it the old-school way I work for it a little at a time and she gets the job done it and it's not to do you know we've always been labeled you know with the first boat out and with the last boat home because we're the slowest boat in the fleet so that's how it is but you know what i don't like getting up early time is the one thing you could still get for free put a couple thousand pounds of tuna on there and maybe moves even slower and everybody was just what it smells like you David spent a lot of time this year you know worried about Tyler TJ etc but you know I don't hear you worrying all that much about the hard merchandise yet we look up today at this stage right at the end here he is ahead of you the word hubris comes to mind how do you how do you feel about about Marciano being a heady oh yeah I've said it before I'll say it again i always say i don't believe in luck but you know what I'm starting to believe in miracles my name did you underestimate him have ya know I know he's caught fish in the past and you know I know he's gonna catch him in the future right now is his time you're sort of a technology guy right i mean we know what you do for a living your pilot you deal with a lot of Technology in the air you got all the fancy stuff on your boat so I what's the relationship between technology and the ability to catch for a technology i'm gonna use it to my advantage you know that's that's what it's all about I want to catch as many fish as I can ultimately catch the most fish gonna make the most money Tyler any surprise to you to see Dave Marciano where he's at this point absolutely not because phenomenal fishermen he's been for years I group is 10 12 15 16 years old hearing his name over and over again you know he didn't get the tuna fish as much as you wanted to because he was getting nuttin when he went to an efficient you put his head to doing it he caught him and we even used to work for TJ we solicited Marciano's got him on the radio all the time I mean heat the guy's the real deal I mean you know he's got a solo I mean I'm only two knots quicker 10 Nazis eight knots eight-and-a-half you mean it's we have boats that get us to the ground you know we leave earlier than everyone we come in later than everyone and that's always been our style that's why I've always kind of looked up the hard merch mart and I think people like to throw the word underdog around and talking about you and your crew and your Bo do you like that term or is it an insult for you know like today it is what it is the boat's nothing special but I make it work right in like Tyler was saying a slow boat it's economically viable right we can catch him as cheaply as possible that's one thing to that works in our favor even if you do catch a less fish i put more money in my pocket hey one thing is true about speed speed costs money bigger engine bigger horsepower bigger fuel bill speed costs money there's no way around that again I'll set it before i don't mind getting out of bed at midnight you know it gave you know gets out of bed at five o'clock and blows bias just before sunrise but you know what that's just what money and put in my pocket you can't help but think of the tortoise and the hare as there is racing as you use so instead he just kind of making your way out there and slow and steady win this race you're not fine i don't know because like i'll admit to speed is an edge without a doubt especially in certain situations the bike goes off we hear about you need to get somewhere that's where guy like Dave has a huge edge over me he's going to get there and maybe get fish that I won't get or maybe get more fish than i can get cause he got there for us that's definitely an edge you know what without a doubt but again I've been doing this a long time and I don't do it to be on first I do it to do is well as i can for myself my family and if we wind up on top well so be it hard merchandise as we know is having their best season ever but for the new boat drama it all came to a crashing halt this week for the first nine weeks of the season captain Paul cheating is guys had not caught a single tuna and if they didn't catch one this week they knew they could not afford to fish any longer the final trip ended with the boat breaking down and the guys even further in the red with an expensive to-- let's see how it happened we came all the way to play the boat 60 miles in Boston going on one last vision trip this is our Hail Mary pass just cut it off so it doesn't get in here right now we have a small issue the boat the Paul down below probably shooting it but we need six quick because we need get on the board and we have no fish right now go for stucco at Platts and no one else is around we're in trouble we got a call for a tow and we have no fish Paul it it didn't go well it didn't go well for you guys this year your boat breaks down that's kind of the nail in the coffin for you how how tough was that how heartbreaking was it for you to hang it up for the year to say the least like the worst year we've ever had like I don't know how much more bad luck we could have was your bad you mean don't have to say that don't ever say I hope it was my worst year ever since I always well don't always now we are in a burpies law right hi know i know i have had an awesome crew this year I mean we tried we went out we lost a ton of fish we broke down we just had a lot of misfortunate does not believe in locks so i won't ask whether it was bad luck the doing the drama of sheer but what do you think it was an experience what happened bad preparation but what are you going to go Brown you know what I left the dog but especially when I gotta escorted back to shore and that was just my bad bro come on ma'am I mean come you're like older than me gotta have you together it comes out yeah I get my guys almost sink this past fall get every safety gear together you know what when you're the captain of that boat you're in charge everyone that's on those boats lives they looked for you for guidance totally agree you know right Robert planning prevents piss-poor performance yep an estimated $OPERAND / Coast Guard and yeah that was a bad and that was a dead dad knew all that is and I could have wagered money that Marciano had some sort of a long-running saying just like that you've got one of those for just about everything there is a clich√© there's a sailing he's we call them what are they again make sure I understand the fryer proper planning prior proper performance Paul you lost two fish there were some other things too though you swap paint with another boat at the marina I'm just trying to walk down the list here you didn't have an excitable soon the coast guard escorting you back to Gloucester and then this week you pull out of the dark while you're still connected to shore power let's see so we're hoping for a problem free trip when I under the boat just hop right on you don't need to spin it anywhere all your power back up need that kidney backup is that it's never easy story of the year doing I'm thought that bringing it right around i give up and back to square one we're also though friend you ready rockin i'll be honest let's just forget this season will work and we're going 2015 2015 goal number one captain who going along out of the capital in a Martian you've been doing this for the longest time of anyone in this group so think back what were some of the rookie mistakes you remember making all of those oh look at you know what happens when you lose fish it's it's part of the learning curve but you know what like you know I talk to these guys that was pulling for him all year but it'sit's too inefficient is one of those things to you don't get it from a bark you don't learn it from any other way except to go out there and make mistakes and learn from your mistakes and you'll get better at it as time goes on robotic Dave I'm sure you never made any mistakes even as a rookie know any manuals right absolutely what kind of what kind of mistakes remember making i did the same thing I pulled out of the dr shore power in but unfortunately we didn't get to it i'm an ironworks i don't know i remember a day when the tuna.com you should be called the tuna.com you've come a long way since Emily I was like 15 or 16 when people used to call you that and also when i was twenty guy was all well tell you you've been doing this probably the least amount of time it's at least in terms of accounting a game of them captain definitely by last week or last year I see the fish didn't exactly jump up onto the boat where you may have some clothes to rookie mistakes last year as well actually like definitely more so you know the fish was tough my health wasn't so good and I had new mates so I had everything stacked against me and I'm ready to every year yeah but you know where they had new mates had never fished before you know I have my friends and I grew up fishing with because I've been fishing for a long time and I've been catching fish for a long time so I have kids that come with me from various points I brought two brand new kids on the boat and they're very tough year you know what didn't work out in my I'll tell you what when there's fish around this past summer like there were I put them across the dock all matters we're going to see you back there next here we are able to regroup I am gonna go back i'm going back with the same crew i love the guys first step for driving school I can't like talk how well they did you know I mean that I can't talk enough about how well they did and yeah I messed up a lot this year I'm coming back and and hopefully everybody myself we'll see what happens when those guys want to get back out there with you i hope so i had to talk him into it first as I mean is not coming back up the percentage a little bit i'm sure the yeah exactly percentage of what you said it's all with her arm down the poor guy alone let them move on let's get back to your boat our on the pinwheel this week things were interesting I guess let's say it's the only way they should be all right Tyler and Travis lost the fish early in the week when Travis drove over the fishing line and then when they hooked up again later in the week Travis was struggling on the wheel Tyler let's say he lost his cool but he definitely pushed him to the ground here's our looked pretty neutral you get that the bone you dumbass turn around that we put about what turn that way now running out of my way she had to kill doing a bitch Tyler now after you finally landed the fish by yourself after pushing how old is he 14 15 years old you push the poor guy to the ground was sad he said you were you said 19 is like nearing child abuse and any of that you push the poor guy to the ground terrible whatever you decide this all-star we're gonna mold general really seem all that upset or you said you were sorry you really seem all that sorry sorry no you know you just one thing you know traps have been molded them all season and he's talking a big game so you gotta back that came up and he's backing up when it comes to driving the boat were fighting fish you're making the wrong decisions this is costing us money you know it's already added stress without us having David so it's very important that we catch every fish we can you know we're gonna tight competition have a lot to prove after what happened to me in the previous season so I I can't afford to lose a fish because of Travis's inexperienced would you handle it the same way if you could do it again absofreakinlutely get on my way we gotta catch the fish the fish end up on the deck yeah the check cashed yea travis get paid yeah I'm pretty sure everyone was happy with the end result is a short-term line of thinking is there a long-term view that if you keep pushing too many mates eventually they're gonna say no thank you even though I've got official not here to be a beauty is plenty of them to come so you just no worries by if he's going to change me you just bring the next one way to see you go there's a big difference finger Diego know how to catch a bluefin tuna and I don't care who's on my back deck we're gonna get it done with mirrors are tougher than others but i'll tell you what you say we made you're out you know what I won't be in that top 5% because there's a reason for that I don't doubt that but you know what my boat my way and I go to see for a reason because i like being out to sea and I like being out there in the ocean if I want to work on land get along with people i take a beach job but then again you know I mean somebody's back right now you hear the veteran guys in the flea talk I hear over and over again how important chemistry is Dave I know talks all about the chemistry with Sandro I I know Marciano talks about the chemistry with your family and yet you seem to say hey whatever one mates is the same as the neck if I didn't come from fish in the center console in my twenties like and catching like fish by myself all the time then I probably think like that but for me I'm still useful enough where I feel I can catch him by myself he will I lose some because of that absolutely but I still feel at the end of the day if i were to fish myself for a whole season i would still turn a profit I mean to forget tuna fish we all understand the patterns we understand how to catch them if you play them out long enough you're gonna get them if you want to try and get them quick and happy all erratic at you're gonna lose a lot of fish that's where that second I could help you well debut push Tyler this year now we've seen Tyler push a mate's what did you make it what happened on that boat he shouldn't a poly ball would have done you can certainly make that you don't push your mates but you know he did what he did it's in the heat of the moment and you know people you never push someone out of the way you give you a harpoon give you a cat oh never never cashed in officially boyfriend and like you're dealing with humans you know you deal with people you know I mean I would I wouldn't do that for for a tunafish I don't think right now I know it's my livelihood stuff like this you gotta do something real quick yeah I'm not gonna I'm not gonna hurt one of my friends or my mates or something that works for me it's just someone i got to first mean it's not like there really people at all just that they're disposable your case it's only you are what three four times the size of James just want to be right so I know it no pushing on your building yeah it wouldn't you know you know yet but I'm not immune to losing my temper right I'm not gonna sit here and you know call the kettle black you know what I mean I've made mistakes I've had my share of blow-ups I try not to let it happen and you know it but Tyler's right though it's his boat his way to a certain extent you know he's right like that and you know none of us are perfect i think you know I think we can all admit that right now all I'm not our job to myself in the day you know Travis he totally understands that you know like what I'm doing what I'm trying to get him do is the right thing i didn't get to where I am for no reason I'm not doing in the fishery for no reason so I think he gets it you know yet and when we talk about it you know he reflected I understand moving about the wrong way didn't factor in the tide in the wind and where he's going to learn it's just were so intense at this point in the season and the fish worth so much money that every single fish counts I can't afford to lose one well you say that and you say that he's feeling better about it certainly you don't feel a lot of remorse for the way things went but we also got to see what happened at the weigh-in and I don't know that I would say Travis look like he was entirely over at let's all watch together take care of my baby is the beautiful fish out here I don't care what it was long as you get paid and I don't have to quit i don't quit I don't want to leave this but I earned this job if i keep getting pushed around I'm outta here did I wouldn't let you quit I just throw the old you almost did you don't you meet walkway learn all the secrets get them over this is too good of a year I expect they're going to be like on my level and obviously it's not going to be the case right away Travis is just getting broken into this type of fishing i freak out but you know what the most important thing is getting well you know the 7-eleven down the streets have like 19 different cashiers at last three months so the back of the Penrose had eight or nine meet so you're doing better than my local cell you know what do ya want everything you just said only gonna get on that shit look at the school yard anyway you don't mean it's just like two kids at the playground can't get along with each other are you worried Tyler that will walk away you know what I mean I know Travis those fishing and his hearts in his blood I know at the end of the day he's got to deal with my there's a lot to it but he wants to catch fish and he's happy where he's at and I know he'll be there when I need them can you repair that relationship do you need to repair that relationship I definitely repair I mean I'm under a lot of stress we lost David Davis my ace in the hole I all of a sudden now putting all that pressure right on Travis you know what he's got big shoes to fill and this is a new fishery to him he's not done this before so I'm putting a lot of pressure on him he's at his breaking point I'm at my breaking point when a big competition here we're making good money this season so you know what I think I need to focus on our my relationship with travis and everything's gonna be ok alright guys thank you so much that's

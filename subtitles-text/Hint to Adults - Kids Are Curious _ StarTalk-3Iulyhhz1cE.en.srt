I don't know why people continue to concern themselves with getting kids interested in STEM field that's a mystery to me because all kids are interested in STEM fields the adults that are the problems the dole to run things to wield resources we have political cultural economic power those are the ones who are clueless not entirely clueless but close enough to be bungling stumbling along the way trying to figure out what to do about the human forces on our environment or or any matter of science literacy that affects us today I'm too impatient to wait for the eighth grader to become old enough to run the country to say now we have a scientifically literate leadership adult outnumber kids 521 kids are born curious and they get booted out of beaten out of him by the time they're in high school by adults in the first year the life teaching them to walk and talk the rest of the wives telling him to shut up and sit out every kid you've ever met for questions that's what a scientist is were full of questions the kid thinks that there exists an answer to every one of their questions and that you the adult have that answer the great transition that it has to make his realizing that not only does the specific adult not necessarily have all the answers to some questions they might pose where no adult has the who hasn't been discovered yet these are the moments of curiosity we need to cherish her children but to presume it's not there we have to put it in them know take another look at your kids the task of the adults should be stay out of the way that the curiosity rent-free and let the children run free while the adults actually learn some science closer in charge

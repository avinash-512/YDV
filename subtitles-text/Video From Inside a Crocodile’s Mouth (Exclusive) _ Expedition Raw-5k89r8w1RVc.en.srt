put it down put it on the water put on the water our idea was to get the very first video and photos ever have a crocodile's jaws closed around the camera people have seen crocodiles on the shore when your boat but no one has seen crocodiles up close personal because they're too dangerous which is why we're using these remote control votes we had straps phone to them and we put GoPros inside thought it'd be really cool and we also might learn something about how crocodiles attack things we got our very first at the very first appointment it was just cause around a camera longer I mean almost sent it two seconds he was gone that's how quick you disappear if you're in fact just matched it I mean it was yeah great fifty years ago there are almost no crocodiles in northern Australia and all that right now everywhere you go there are crocodiles are crocodiles in every bill bond crocodiles and every creak crocodiles and every River Oh the main mission on this last trip was to drive these remote control boat see if we can destroy them and they went remarkably well

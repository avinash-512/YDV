John was who's lonely and he was depressed he wasn't a monster by any me you know he was a normal young man who started getting sick and doesn't get the right help and time wasn't medicate it mental helpful was different back then they didn't understand it as much as we do now we still don't understand it to the point where we would want to you suffered primarily from schizotypal disorder schizotypal personality disorder can be anything from void of emotion or too much emotions so then it's just kind of day-to-day you know he suffered from depression and borderline personality disorders during that time of struggle he taxi driver came out and I think he saw the movie something 17 to 30 times and you know he had obsessions he had mental illness so he he began to really relate with the Travis Bickle character and he was obsessed with the beatles and Bowie and in poetry I mean he was a hopeless romantic so I think when he saw that Jodi was going to yell can only he saw her as a real person that maybe one day he would meet and then maybe she would fall for him and then it just kind of spirals from there you know the the odds aren't as big as before you know she's going to college she's she's normal there's a chance that if I run into her she could fall in love with me and then it becomes it goes from there too I I think she already is in love with you know so that's when the reality and fantasy start to travel

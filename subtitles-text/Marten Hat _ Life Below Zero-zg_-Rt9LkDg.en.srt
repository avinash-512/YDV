so once i get them to this point a lot of times I like to hang them up so I can work on a little bit better very little goes to waste wanted to kind of take your time and get it started pretty good and you can pretty much just pull straight down on just drop them on the board the way they grade these verses the length from the nose here to the base of the tail that's what you get graded on so the longer it is within reason the better thing I like to do is once they're on the board like this just taking the lower legs stretching them out your distrust trying to expose the flesh so it will dry out i'd like to just tack them on gently first final thing you do to go stretcher here you stick that up in there if you don't do that the skin dry so tight that you won't be able to get it off the this allows you to have something you can remove leaves a little bit of slackness in the first just needs to dry tonight I want this to feel like paper tomorrow morning probably come in with a cup of coffee turn all these Martin around and put them back on the board let them dry for a couple more days and then they're ready for tanning and making a habit out of if I can take four and make something out of it it has a much higher value not only monetarily but personally for me for I trap today is going to keep me warm for many years to come

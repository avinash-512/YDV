yeah a dude rob is a little cosmos with its homeworlds creatures drama i wanted to take the ship of the imagination on an epic voyage into the biosphere of a single dewdrop we're entering the dewdrop and damages showing cell structures showing close-ups else is aiding and looking creatures that are greed and animals smaller than the head of a pen we took still images from scanning electron micrographs and the BF x team were able to give them motion and give them life we take you down and keep changing scale until we're at the microcosmic scale level when you get down to those levels and you conceptualize it a whole new world emerges you're looking at something that's even in the microscope it's hard to see and so it's doing that seamless transition from one world into another world and showing you with that when you're walking on grass and there's a little dewdrop there you have no idea you're stepping on the entire universe that's life in the drop

we get to know the real talk and we are on you just watch the latest episode of wicked tuna now it's time for wicked tuna realtalk the weekly web show were your favorite bluefin tuna captains and well sometimes you're not so favored captain's as well or here in the hot seat to give us their take on the latest episode my name is mike Salk i will be your host once again joining us this week our captain TJ on the Hot Tuna captain Dave Carraro of fishing vessel tuna.com and Tyler McLaughlin the captain of the pinwheel welcome to the show guys on this new episode we saw . com catch the biggest fish of the season at least so far we saw tjs younger brother mike managed to avoid getting fired from the Hot Tuna crew well we'll delve into that he found his place on the team thankfully but let's start here this week Dave you came back pretty hot you just started you know scorn fish so what is it where you motivated that kind of lock you in you had so much frustration the week before did you just feel released to go out there and catch fish now I thank him for me catching those two fish just that little bit of frustration just that there's nothing more that I want to do right now and then go out and get official make a statement and we did you don't strike me as the guy was a problem focusing I mean you're not like Ed guy all over the place from here to there I mean you're pretty focused guy generally so this is just what laser pinpoint now I have a task and this is what I'm gonna go after exactly exactly he poked I've and then we're ready to go bring it bring it well time I don't overlook the same for you I meanwhile Dave kinda you know was able to shore up his focus you didn't have your best week I mean you catch a fish but you know what how're you feeling in the aftermath of what happened we get under your skin not really i'm just caught some fish you know coming up to my spot that I found you know yet to come up there you never caught a fish up there before your boat and fishing main for years and just hurt me you come up to the bottom that I'm fishing i gotta look out my window and see you catch six hundred pounder very dry victory drive me nuts is about a freshman of these two guys Oh make sure you make the right is a little pressure around and dealing with a lot of this tell me who's the baddest that's good what he just said I I think they're both great fisherman arm they both finished up and down the coast they both are good in certain areas you know some Davis better in some spots and Tyler's better than others so I mean Dave's got one more experience i will give him that but the same time Tyler's prove himself so where their strengths where do you work where what when I say bye cons in South Jeffries and close to Gloucester and some of those areas Dave you know and Sondra they're phenomenal exactly hard to be but Tyler knows may need fish to make quite a bit he's fish down you know if the Carolinas and stuff so he's a little more well-rounded in that area see things more location-based supposed two different things you guys are able to do yeah well because certain areas you fish it differently that you would anywhere else if I told you have you know if you approach a spot 200 miles away from where we fish with the same methods we do in that area or you're not gonna put together you're gonna watch other guys go off around you you like my nails a lot more if I men coming up next to the blackboard on Stellwagen vs of making up next time in maine exactly it up next to the main I'm thinking I'm LeBron James because you know what you're doing there no I'm doing what happens that tides and currents and everybody always like having what time of the day then i think i have to water rights when they come through you got an hour there's a lot of tuna heroes in our industry that think they're the best of the best right and if you took them out of their little niche where they fish and putting over they'd watch everyone they take pictures and they wouldn't have anything to write on facebook how great they were actually makes the three-month let me start to phenomenon captain's a go and catch fish that was always my goals of fishermen to be able to hang in there in every spot and you know maybe not be the best in one particular area but say I can go there and compete Tyler for you where do you draw the line what winter you in someone's head and getting under their skin in a positive way and whether you annoying people in the fleet how do you how do you walk that one I don't know i just kind of roll with the day and see how much trouble I get myself into on that day so it's never ending for me I mean I don't check and balance what I'm doing I mean I'm like my own boss out there on tuna boats i mean i really don't anyone to keep me and socially on our seating and right is that a good thing that I was his own boss not cracked out left and he said that I was like yeah well I have a little time so you know what's right what's wrong and you kind of lose perspective moved what's exactly appropriate what's exactly allowed when you're out there in the middle of the ocean nothing going on you kind of go crazy i think it's funny there are times when I feel like this is like a therapy session for Tyler's were sort of working out his issues along the way in real talk after we see a trend here we hide our soul I mean we need new doctors i have laid out on a leather couch a bunch of that I didn't help him yeah yeah yeah you have no idea how many times I tried to get through it all do you think you guys can be friends days and your time and become friends I totally respect him as a fisherman i would like to respect him as a person if I could just see him grow up and be a parallel to Sandro's mentality yes i think so want to look like these two guys are on the same boat but never ever works couldn't happen just personality conflict no man Odd Couple extreme alright well we're going to see our own little odd couple drama play out on the Hot Tuna teacher you get your brother on there and he was struggling I mean you guys have that shark on the line and he didn't look like he wasn't exactly hop to it so how's it been what were the early goings like with my you know he came out like a zombie way slower than we expect him to arm and I i think i was a little hard automatons for sure I know Michael knows what's going on and I don't want to yell at him because I try to keep the boat comment if you get everyone kind of nervous and on edge things are gonna go wrong and and I don't like to do that but at times I had to raise my voice just because I don't know what the hell he was doing that and I know better than throw the anchor rope on the line yeah i mean stuff like that you know and those are rookie rookie mistakes and you know yeah there's so many things that could go wrong throughout about you know where you could possibly lose a fish something like that is unnecessary and bush league would you really fire your brother i probably will i have my mother would be to happen if i had to yeah i mean i have my father would fire me right you know that's what they said they're going to business with families this is a perfect example having family to yours you know listen that the other day it's it's gonna work out but there's been some major bumps in the road come around all day we've seen you fire god you know you fire Paul and he's cold-blooded well that i know i mean we don't need to do the show to color is uploaded but what does that I mean you and Paul were closed you together for a long long time how was that moment when you finally say I gotta make a decision and I gotta do it I mean it's it wasn't me it's an easier decision for me to make that is for him you know he's got family Paul is somewhat family we're close friends but you know it's it's it's a business move you know if you're not playing well you know it's my decisions time to move on i got applying someone that's gonna bring harmony to the tuna.com and Paul was basically put it putting us in a negative direction something that had to be done fortunately well Mike ended up redeeming himself and that sort of yeah great part of this episode today is that maybe you can run so that did you know that he I mean obviously you know that he's got that in yeah I mean listen I gotta give him credit I wouldn't want to be down that engine room for three hours manning the hydraulic system wall it was really hot that day was like 85 degrees up the engine room is you know the engine 270 degrees so he definitely earned his keep and I get a lot of credit you know hehe definitely helps with that fish how to might feel after that I mean it seems like he's pretty down I mean he looked a little worrisome yeah he's a big baby yeah i was firing jay-z yeah he's a big bear you know he's still he comes across as mean and nasty but he's a nice guy but after how do you filming was he did he did he i think is it already intention yeah i bought a shot i was proud of him you know that fish was a real hair puller and I mean it i think we were honored for three-and-a-half hours and then I ended up fighting it for quite a while Charlie care to do much anymore you know Michael was a major part of that catch I'm proud of him gallery also get to see kind of flipping out in this episode and towards the end you Dave catches a fish and it really got under your skin and is this just the leftover from the confrontation at the docks is are you having trouble controlling your emotions and stay and even out there what happened it was tough for me because I'm up here on a spot all alone no other boats and I started to see boat set I'm competing against showing up I'm not too happy when I see them catch a fish on the spot i found he's already ticked me off yeah he's starting to get under my skin a little bit but I'm still focused I know what I gotta do something to catch tuna spicy Dave smiling Susan through the harpoon hit that fish one thing popped in my mind that nice orange poly ball oh I will tell you what though you know what I it definitely seems that i'm your biggest competition is no doubt that there's no doubt about and that's the funny part is why you're so worried about thailand you guys it's a word about you each other TJ ends up kind of storming into the lead did you lose track of what was going on around you that's right you know he's only that's alright as long as I'm catching up to him that's really yeah so you will write out right now that's how serious you're taking this rivalry is that you will not only wanted I see black when I hope that all season yeah this seems perfect for you yeah it's great man i was totally out of the loop of baby stuff you know they go out and I'm not gonna mention what's more important to you this year Tyler's it is it winning or as a beating Dave it's taken back the title is it i think i'm the best fisherman amongst these captains and I want to catch the most fish that's what it's about you know I don't want any of the box right I think we all think the same way I mean we all want to catch the most fish we all want to win I mean catch the most fish you win you're gonna make the most money most likely yeah I want to catch a few for sure but if one of these guys guess what next thing I'm not gonna punch my home chair and not be mad at my home state did nothing wrong to alright hey guys it's good to have you in once again for Real Talk a big thank you to all three

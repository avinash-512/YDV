have you ever thought about how weird humans are I think about how weird you are i mean most mammals are all hairy but we're not let's retrace so it's true that our ancestors were actually pretty hairy but what happened to all that firm hey guys Julia and Julia here for dnews so we got a lot of questions from you guys in the comments on facebook on Twitter one we've received a few times is why do we have eyebrows thanks to stabilization and james wright who both ask this one in our recent evolution of toes video but to answer that question we've got to explore why we lost our fur in the first place researchers believe that over 3 million years ago we looked more like this but obviously we evolved out of our thick coats why help researchers believe that as the climate change we moved out of the trees under the hot scorching savannah and according to one study published in the journal Current anthropology around 1.2 million years ago to cope with the heat we lost forever and started sweating a uniquely efficient way to cool off Proceedings of the Royal Society B suggest that while we lost most of our hair through natural selection sexual selection finish the job the researchers believe that humans like naked partners not for obvious reasons but because it helps them to see whether they have parasites are not parasites like fleas or ticks can cause deadly diseases like typhoid so bare skin means a healthier mate but there's a different Biology Letters suggest that we kept some of our body hair to spot some of those bugs and this study researchers shape have been pair of volunteers arm and put a bed bug on their skin wait how did they get people to agree to the station hey anyway is the researchers noticed that the volunteers spotted the bug more quickly on their hairy our parts the men in the study were actually better at spotting the bugs and the women so maybe women selected dates with more hair because they can see their parasites on them ok what is it just me or are those two completely conflicting studies yeah they are these are two competing theories were really not sure whether hair helps or hurts when it comes to parasites so as usual more research is needed but there's actually another possibility here maybe men are hairier because like it some researchers think that since hair is controlled by hormones like testosterone men are hairier right and testosterone also increases the size of hair follicles on the face  I think beard and a maid of chest hair could be a sign of how much testosterone that guy has speaking of facial hair do you know why I have these magnificent eyebrows don't look at me like that I'm not the only one wondering well researchers think they work really well I keeping sweat out of our eyes which would be useful as we evolved to thrive in a hot climate and they're great for nonverbal communication so we also can't not talk about body hair without talking about hair in our armpits and pubic area's true turns out researchers think here in these areas does double duty first and wicks away moisture which is super helpful for dealing with the savannahs on it also might trap sense which is actually a good thing right maybe these hairs evolved to trap the human musk to appeal potential meets while human pheromones haven't been found they have been theorized right like how some studies show that women prefer the armpit odor of men with compatible immune systems so armpit hair could trap more of this some alluring scent or some researchers think because pubic hair growth coincides with puberty maybe it's an outward sign of sexual maturity like an advertisement saying look at me i'm ready to meet and speaking of meeting pubic hair might serve as a cushion during sexy times that protects the genitals from abrasions or micro tears whereas protection from things like dirt so while some people might think body hair is gross we really don't have as much as we used to and what we do have is a very important job to do so put that razor down or actually don't because it might be that your beard is really gross trace explains why over here researchers sprayed beards with non infectious bacteria and allowed them to rest in the hair for a while then they wash their after cleaning there was still enough bacteria to spread to other people okay so you were like an uncle fester or cousin it let me know down in the comments below or if you have a question go ahead and leave it down in the comments to and use the hashtag ask dnews

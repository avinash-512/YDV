conservation is a bourgeois concept what we do is we create a huge amount of carbon and we expect poor people to look after our carbon sink for us and they can't because we haven't got anything I want to live with more illegal loggers now I want to understand their lives more his bait 080 is very religious he believes that the rainforest is the living embodiment of Christ yet he's cutting it down so I you know I wanted to know why a man with such reverence for the for the forests respect for it would do that and his wife left him we stopped two girls he's putting through college neither of them will speak to him because he's a logger that's beneath them all his money goes to send his girls to go through he's now an alcoholic so he's living this tragic life and having to do that we got the worst thing you can buy thought you know I thought illegal logging was bad in Manu and Peru and and then I went to Brazil this what the Amazon looks like an actor in western Brazil or not you want to send ish United percent of rainforest destruction in the Amazon is for agriculture so i went there and this really was the Badlands this is my buddy Dino is just about the most environmentally destructive human being I've ever met he truly is the worst nightmare even the patent he found his dad dead and hanged himself when he was a boy he managed to get himself a little bit land in the rainforest had a family managed to pull it off got himself farm that's how he survived this is his granddaughter Anna Clara yeah every time we got a camera and a claro is there and she was so happy to have like loading you people to hang out what and everyone did everything together and it was a real family affair but what they did was this United diabolica wins group may I google scholar and saying you have your hip and with-it this out Fleur yeah everyone's desperate for me to like the first numbers need for no good idea then the full there you do it yeah I like with your extra that credible that simple ready to heat coming off that thing about 50 feet away everyone's getting the hell out no he's not he's going to start the move version you wanna might want to date but gotta give up went back the next day I saw the rainforest light and one of the reasons what do you know does so bad was because what you're doing is you're cutting down a rainforest which produces oxygen you're burning it releasing on the carbon then you're covering grass and grazing it with cows and globally count produce more greenhouse gases and all of the transport combine that every plane car ship you name it globally so it couldn't be any worse for the environment what the note does do I like him any less for it now i have huge amount of respect for Dino I learned a lot from him he taught me happy better dad had a better family man but he taught me also that to him the forest is a resource to me is you know romantic ideal to him it's the resource and when we think of people of the forest we think of with this romantic notion of people living in harmony with the fart you know Dino Erasmus baito ilyass they're just as much people of the forest and until we start understanding that realizing and accepting it we're going to struggle to go forward the one thing I think I came away knowing most was that concept you know I have the time and the money to care and these guys don't have that and you know when you look at the problems of the Amazon what you're looking at is really four main things you're looking at the extraction of gold cocaine Brazilian beef and tropical hardwood trees like mahogany and we're the end users of those products and what we do is we much more than these guys you pumped into the atmosphere and we expect poor people with nothing to look after our carbon haven't got anything and when we shout mon recalling bastards chopping down the room for us so what was I going to do with iliaster that was the big thing you know at this man I've done my journey what am I going to do well I getting a job I said all right you're the worst illegal longer in the air and replanted I'm trepidatious I'm not stupid there's a very high chance of failure but I'm not gonna let that cloud my excitement about the whole like their affiliates working with me and yes it might fail but I do trust him as well as paying ilias charlie is going to bring in experts who understand how to restore damaged rain forests rainforest tenemos una expensive casino 112 sorry too low doses moving a lot wanna go home dosis de bras√≠lia they're going to plant a mixture of hardwoods and fast-growing soft words as well as bananas and other crops can grow alongside the provide alias with a second income with any luck we'll be self-sufficient within five years I think the thing about this is so simple in symbolic planting trees but into one with here today doing it and you know I'm doing this with Elias and that's that's the key to this not putting trees in the ground that trees goats who I'm actually here doing it on asking him to do it together got more of these to go and get a whole rainforest the plant . they're done charlie didn't find a way to protect the National Park but in this corner of the Amazon is already made a difference watching Heidi in Des of how quite brand sometimes it hits me so from a very happy way it was very nice moment to watch but it was something really wretched about it as well because it's it's not solving a massive problem it's solving a very tiny problem and it hasn't even sold it yet but I feel like at least I'm doing something even if it's just one tiny small thing with this is all we can do is hope isn't actually that's bullshit all within this hope of gal4 asses and do something two years later did it were no you have too many other pressures on his life I saw him in the summer and use all embarrassed and I thought you have been embarrassed huh I don't live in your shoes I judge you or you have any blame at all and it but it was very sad because he was you know he's kind of felt like it let himself down and I didn't I don't know how hard the asses like this I couldn't say but they had a new daughter named jasmine and he might be but you know the most awful illegal locker but he's a nice guy let's end of my talk

either more of a myth that year old to me comfort zone want to go there more often I N MAIN everything is a situational official Star one heart and the soul will be in shortly by bounce around in different spots it's kinda like an early-season spot this is the first year that we really ever seen the bite last as long as it did on Platz implant is a difficult place to figure out it's getting a lot of people travel you do you feel more comfortable there than you do close at Gloucester absolutely I unless impression of my home armor I feel really confident flats and I want anyone who thinks

I am happy I want multilayer upholding never seen it like that before now it's never lasted like that throughout August into September it's never been a consistent usually the blue sharks take over the big pollak in and you just can't get on it now well I want to get your first catch their cuz I was kind of an interesting one we'll get to that in a moment the middle of the night was twenty dinner in his buddies boat but Dave this is not your comfort zone and we get to see you you you like to be in your spot doing your own thing doesn't matter with the rest of the fleet is due in and the

an upper tier one here to make money but if I gotta go up to maine to catch fish and I do what I gotta do but again these guys have been tension there a lot longer than and as we discussed and other episodes you know every spot doesn't touch the same as the so for me to go up there it's gonna it's gonna take me sometimes the chance I like it up there watch everybody else by Depeche you know we're just gonna sit there and do nothing but as a freshman I think I can get dialed in there and you don't think we can get it done TJ use the phrase you're chasing the bite that you chase the bite out there that that doesn't seem like you right now a temperament and leave a baseball player who gets caught in between you start guessing curveball versus fast now an XML you know what's common accident and you totally off kilter can you get that way fishing where hey do I trust myself into I try something new sure I i I typically don't chase news I like to make the news but where I was fishing I was definitely not making the news you know we were taking a snooze it was time to move was time to go on time to go up there figured out make something happen if we continue to stay where we were it was a no win I guess I'm not be as clear a lead as the other thing if I found myself thinking I was like okay it's come a bread twenty times in a row I keep it in black too I switch to read it twice they were black going to get my hands to yourself which we all do and we he had to do it i mean really I will get the credit he never chase bites he'd he stays in does its thing a successful doing that but

middle of the night which he said was worth it and I'm not sure I agree with fast you know flak on conditions you can tweet about to be like that all the time right transmittal the night no big deal something done you can wear fashionable it out on the water I mean you know you gonna when we go ahead on our boats we can drop people off and transfer people no problem where you end up with a hundred and ten inch fish so fine in the middle of how great was that bad wonderful bout on in nineteen efficient awesome they're all over up on top for pine water Kong it's really good you know

quarter mile down the bank into just as good but it's just it's gonna screw you over the heads up you just wanna be costly back in that area we are reproduced wouldn't do anything in your there you've caught a fish in the middle of the night the word get tougher so how does the word get out as everybody find a higher soon to turn a buyer they let us know either other boats at sea catch their call their bodies to be here as they can catch a fish but they can give someone some information and that's what that's like beating on their desires the worst to these are the same guys are going and bring in the fish to the guy at a look in as the real bad the mine is not enough in the mail as these guys an orgasm or fish they take in the more money they make okay so they may say on or I want say

as Kant warn their feeding cycle makes it difficult are you more worried that somebody else is gonna catch a fish or that somebody's gonna that is gonna make it more difficult for you to catch because I've all want it on the line it's gonna and a brother the line by me know that is both super light line now different things educating officials and I'm not knowing how to handle big fish like that

so on the ball how's that working out no jury jody has some experience in these he's proven himself ready and out I'm gonna get my shot at it I think he's gonna be a great asset to develop well you guys are fighting for territory up in maine you weren't the only ones we also saw the harpoon guys getting after each other quite a bit and a hollywood just attract trouble right now what about him that just attract some of the anger bitterness competition that seems to fall well he's not very quiet either so I mean we love would but he he does Steph we look for and those guys said he he's fine with there are very prominent figures in our porn industry got the best best arbiter in NJ zero two their anti plane right they're not for the plane do it all on visual they're very talented guys and they're probably the best at that so that would allow myself to woodys what he's pretty damn good to hear mom to say the plane plane right yet into this way nizar anti playing big-time so jus it is your chance at that these guys are out there you know that they're doing it the way they did the prudent way seen on my site and chasing down whereas when he's getting called in with herds are and nothing gets to play me i i love them appointed by our promo so but for the would you go up there with his plane stick a fish right for them they don't like that it looks to me like that there is doing business and fun right like Legos you can have a plane it's a business decision to go catch as many as you can as opposed to her the challenge of trying to go out there guys are going to just as good as some the guys with the plane really yes sir apple red haired yes sir their top produce about that but he was fighting with are some other bets are posing every customer we gonna harpoon yeah I have yeah I know you know but I don't think I'm going TJ TJ driving I was attacked on embryos I was everything okay hold I how hard is it to you the difference in your yard winners on your phone call you know there's refractive the water column right you know I throw out that you are run-up back to that thing it's actually happening daily danger is not stable it you're staying up there it's very it's very wobbly you fall off the boat running over right there are guys from the Cape that they can do in their slimming really yeah it's an art it's an art it no doubt a lot of people think it's it's that its of air its sheen but those guys from serenely difficult the best in the business event on our plans and Sarah located so what you get into the run real stuff instead anatomy the quake just like just like what you do better I want to drive around a look for tunes are they want to play dates for men trying to check on the Muni child anything I've had a huge respect for the harper's I think it's it's phenomenal into a public if leaders at how many people in there while there's a different quote early as a small quote i mean that there's quite a few arpa both but the 50 police couple handfuls a guys that are extremely successful aa call 1800 things that racket yeah I think the big thing Press why women shoes are putting any there's a lotta restrictions on it if it's not sunny and it's not mom you cannot harpoon we can fish in all types whether so those guys can get held up at the dock for two weeks at a time taken as a whole season as the water warms up you know the fish push down to work on whether or not running digesting my there early in the season was colder they have a very small window to make a lot of money it does seem like they got a lot of big fish though  it seems a lot of the fish they got what they can pass on the biggest ones they that they that are out there they just seem like fun on a thought for now on in and it's pretty amazing really at those guys have been really critical collecting data for us over the years the plains you know what we're fighting for quote over the government's up without that we will also call it a long time ago in the other thing that seems interesting on that strikes me as they you're seeing big schools and Fisher with a 35 minute I'm based on that it surprises me that you guys don't have more dual hookups were you get to fish on we can catch those photos fish you get the idea they do not eat those fish are already done eating they're up in the upper water column in a nice warm water one in their core temperatures and are also digesting their food guys are done we can see them on some calm days we'll see them out runnin you know even without having a tower but no way children for them

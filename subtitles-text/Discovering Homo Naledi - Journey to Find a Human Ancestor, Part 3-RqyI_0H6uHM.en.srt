extraordinary people doing extraordinary things by the end of a 21-day excavation we had discovered the richest early hominid site ever discovering this site is one mile away from the site of Stuart contain it's less than half that distance from the second best known site in the entire continent of Africa the side of swore crowns 800 meters it was right under our nose it was an incredible environment of signs there we had a fossil tent where we kept joking that we need a bigger safe and we had to buy more boxes and more bags and we ever envision we'd set up a thing to find a skeleton and we had first hundreds of remains and by the end of it thousands of remains of holidays we would work late into the night I sometimes couldn't get the scientists out of the cave as they excavated four shifts of six or seven hours in these cramped humid conditions and no one could go get them anyway so they could just stay there as long as we want some people have said well it really isn't that dangerous rick is going to demonstrate to you though that just because we did not kill anyone that this is every bit as dangerous and extraordinary a risk this has ever been undertaken these are the easy parts you're looking at this was an original thing we called Superman crawl which you go through i can get through that so that's not a particularly tight squeeze in the scheme of what we're doing for those of you who are squeamish about closed spaces you may look away because it gets worse the this is the type of journey that these remarkable scientists the runners people who assisted us would take on a daily basis usually three four five times a getting to these sites some people said to me why haven't you open this cave up I hope you can begin see how fragile this case is you do not want to do any opening of caves in that environment because if you do you may destabilize the entire system and it could collapse and secondly I didn't want to do that who was it for me to destroy a cave this potentially millions of years old just so it could be large enough that my ego can get in there when there is technology and extraordinary people who have the capability of doing that work today here this is kind of a normal narrow passage you're going to see the shoot and parts of it here and you'll get an idea of the depth as you see Steve Tucker's light in the distance as we look down into the shoot you an idea of how narrow those spaces are that they are traversing down you'll see out dangerous some of the loose rocks are this rock that Rick is about to touch actually fell on the National Geographic photographer and shattered his fingers as he was under there oh and Rick can dislocated shoulders watch I just show you that for fun discovered in the history of the planet more fossil hominids had come out individually have been discovered in the previous 90-year history of the search for human origins in southern Africa all because of these remarkable scientist  we would name a new species Homo already home in the lady was an incredible creature a brain the size of the orange primitive characters in advance characters teeth that are remarkable and being a little bit human-like and the primitive in so many other ways things we've never seen before we would eventually find 15 individuals 1574 fossils from an area that big by that pig the entire floor is comprised of these fossils we had every age group represented from near fetal aged infants to the extreme elderly with their teeth Warren right out and everything in between males and females we had fossils like this field has never seen before that is the most complete foot ever discovered in the history of paleoanthropology one of six this is the most complete hand eight the assemblage was remarkable remarkable its diversity remarkable in its preservation remarkable in its quality we simply had seen nothing like all line on the floor of this chamber we would name a new it's a crazy creature brain the size of an orange ape-like shoulders human-like arms ending in a human-like and with the most curved fingers we have ever seen outside the most primitive hominids 45 million year old equivalent it's bizarre its thorax starts ape-like becomes more and more advanced its pillow this is like that of Lucy wide and flared so we know what its legs and feet look like they should be primitive - but they are at the top and become progressively more and more and more and more human-like until you reach the feet and those are the most human-like feet ever discovered since humans look at the size of that head that is a normal-sized modern human in the background that is an adult female of Homo know anything about 450 cubic centimeters we had truly never seen anything to give you an idea of how strange they would have looked that's Lucy on the left in the middle is a very famous skeleton culture convoy of Homo erectus and there you can see a relatively human-like visit there on the right is that almost without being derogatory pinheaded look of hormonal etty with it's very strange profile and it is not in a barren see because we have multiple individuals and they all look exactly alike we now know more about this remarkable species perhaps than almost any other species of primitive human relatives that's ever been discovered we very quickly realized something was strange going on with the way in which these fossils were in that chamber during the course of the excavation we had found on the first day to be transparent three bird bones were owl they were lying on the surface that were clearly much younger somehow it got in there and then we found during the course of the excavation a few tiny rodent in sizers mixed into the sentiment and nothing else nothing but hominids now we add on the team world experts in many many different things but all of us had the same basic training in Physical Anthropology forensic anthropology archaeology all related to human biology and those senior members team knew there was something very strange from word go when you see in the simplest like that we of course began trying to eliminate the obvious it's got to be a predator accumulation but there are no predatory damn marks of day image on any of this phone there's no marks of scavenging we knew very early on that the material had not been transported in there was no sign in the sediments of water transport  we also could tell from the way they were set that they come in one by one by one over time there was time involved in this over on the right-hand side of this image is where that shoot is you can see that the floor slopes away from that and quite literally from that point all the way to the are these bones of home already literally from underneath the shoot we have used i can tell you ground-penetrating radar and other methods we can find no other entrance and we were left eventually with the unlikely conclusion that in fact this must be some sort of deliberate body disposal site that we had for the first time found a species other than humans that in a ritualized and I mean repeated fashion had taken its dead into a chamber and secreted them there over time to prevent whatever from happening to them for whatever reason and that is the hypothesis we put forward that's a fairly remarkable thing because until that moment on sep tember 10 last year when we announced the existence of home already and this situation we had seen deliberate body disposal is sort of the last bastion of what identified us as human when Jane Goodall wrote to Lewis Lee he saying i have seen a chimpanzee using tools he said prophetically we're going to have to redefine what it means to be human we had precious little left until sep tember tent except we deliberately disposed of our dead and whatever that means and should this hypothesis hold true for the first time in history you are meeting another species that did just that what these discoveries tell you is that we may have walked or set foot over most of this planet but we have not seen what we were walking on we have not understood what we were looking at there are extraordinary things to be found and if it is true in a field like paleoanthropology then it must be true in every field of science we need to use discoveries like this to inspire this and the next generation to be explorers to get out in the field to look to prepare yourself to make discoveries to use the technology to inform you but to physically go out and make those discoveries we need ladies and gentlemen to inspire exploration thank you very much yeah

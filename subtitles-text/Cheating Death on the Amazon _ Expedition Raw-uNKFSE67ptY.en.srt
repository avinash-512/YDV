holy crap how part shooting out and we don't want them to pop up man it looks like it would be fairly easy to go around it until we tried the only time I was really worried was when we started to go under it having as hard as we could and started getting sucked into the milking it was loud it was really really loud the goal is to be the first expedition to paddle the full length of the Amazon River from its newly discovered source we look to be going approximately 4,200 miles we've had from about an hour before sunup to about an hour before sundown every day maybe 12 14 hours i downloaded about a hundred poems into my ipod and at night I would listen to these poems and the next day I would run through my head and I recite them to the other guys during the day and the night that surrounds me dark is the pitch from pole to pole I thank whatever God's may be for my unconquerable soul once we get down to the the rainforest though we're gonna be going through what's called the red zone this has been a very dangerous area because the local logically because tribes have been exploited quite a bit by Westerners in the area so they're worried about anybody they see in the area that that that they don't know they're these guys coming down from this village with some guns we were trying to get away as nonchalantly as possible and smiling and waving smile and wave boys but here they come motioning us over to the side I'm not too worried about whether they're gonna shoot us or not at this point I'm really happy that we didn't bring the guns that we had discussed bringing because i think the gun would have shown that we were a threat but i'm still feel better if things were a little even doubt it looks it looks like they have three or four single-shot 20-gauge shot guns there are more of us than there are guns so they can't shoot us all I think they just wanted to find out who we are with how we're doing in their area the expedition take some determination but it doesn't take a superhuman that's for sure anybody can get a whale just you know it's just a bite of the yeah

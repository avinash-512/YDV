I'm often asked is science and religion compatible that are they forever in conflict it the answer is simple it's simple if your religious views contains testable claims about the natural world be ready for them to be shown to be false are you ready for that that that happens often ok so if you're not ready for that then you will have a life of conflict evermore you and your descendants in their descendants in the like the enlightened religious people view science as a means of decoding nature nature that they feel in their heart of hearts is created by God perhaps but they learning about nature rather than the Bible as a means of defining nature if you look at the world that way you will never have a conflict with science Sciences are guiding light for how the universe works so all this conflict that everyone talks about that unfold if you are fundamentalist religion and you are certain that every word in the Bible is the literal truth of an unerring creator of the universe yeah you're gonna spend your life fighting everything and fortunately that's the minority of all religious people so it doesn't hold society societies attempts to advanced civilization invoking the methods and tools and discoveries of science and technology that doesn't hold them back too badly but understand the consequences if you want to bring religious philosophy into the science classroom you will stall the technological progress of your society thereby rendering rendering the future of your society in capable of competing economically this the 21st century where innovations in are the engines tomorrow

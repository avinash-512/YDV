if you look at the brain it looks like multiple Grand Canyon if you look at a mouse-brain you don't see that it's very smooth with the outer mantle of the brain the cortex is very smooth and mouse but we have all these grooves and valleys in human brain the reason why we have all these folds in our brain is because across evolutionary time our brains were getting bigger and bigger and bigger the brain was getting too big and it needed to fit in a scope so this is called the surface area to volume problem the way you increase surface area to volume is by creating these volts you can simply pack more part x and you have a folded brain you know there's a parasite called jewel ones that can do brain surgery on its hopes

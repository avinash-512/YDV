i'm gonna show you how to start chestnut trees from seed the first step is to find a chestnut tree  these are some chestnuts that we harvested you want to promptly heat treat your chestnuts after harvesting them or else you lose them to mold and chestnut weevils got some hot water here 120 degrees seems to be the the best temperature to chill this pathogen that and you want to hold it there for 20 minutes let's go ahead and dump are chestnuts in our cooler we're going to go ahead and throw the lid on this we got this thing right at 120 so all the mold spores and chestnut we both legs are dead now the next step in the process is called cold stratification and what cold stratification does is it leads the chestnut to believe that it's gone through a winter and it's ready to germinate i'm just going to put them back in the bowl we had him the key elements to proper cold stratification is obviously cold moisture and air here's how we're getting air to them we're not going to put a little miss so they can get plenty of transpiration going on moisture we got this is just some peat pots are just going to cover them with a little bit of Pete now for the cold part i'm going to set these in our cold frame which is where we like to stratify things this is our cold frame we're gonna set these little buggies in here this would be a nice place them to hangout for 23 months whatever it takes and you'll start to germinate we're just going to hang out there for a little while

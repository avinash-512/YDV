musk oxen male stand 5 feet at the shoulder and weigh a massive 800 pounds aside from polar bears they are the largest animals that roam the Arctic tundra but even they are vulnerable to predators a pack of arctic wolves catches the herd set yeah the musk oxen scrambled to form a defensive ring the adults equipped with long horns are more than a match for the Wolves but it's not the adults the wolves are after the herd panics and runs it is a fatal mistake their lines broken they cannot protect their young the Wolves separate out a cap though it's as large as the alpha male wolf but calf is still one against many without the help of its heard the CAF eventually succumbs to the pack a few days later the wolf pack is on the hunt again their quarry as before our musk oxen the often tried to run away but this time the adults stick close to their calf built for the frigid Arctic muskoxen will actually overheat if they run for too long they were all around to face off against their pursuers the Wolves try again to make the run but the attempts are half-hearted at best and the oxen stand their ground opting for easier targets the Wolves move on leaving the tundra free for the musk oxen to roam again

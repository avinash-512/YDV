Can Opera Singers Shatter Glass _ StarTalk alright another question micro brews from Mountain View in california is intimated that opera singers can shatter gas by thinking high enough I've not seen it done but I don't see why it wouldn't be possible because they're certain frequencies that are called resonant frequencies and other objects and have you ever done this church maybe not then you go to a tree that's way thicker than anything you you would think of toppling okay and then you just start pushing it right if there is a rhythm with which you can push a tree that pumps the tree in exactly the motion that you originally said it to do it's the same thing is pumping when you're on a swing it's how you can just put yourself into motion without touching anything you've got a sweeping your legs right at the right moment that will add to that motion when you took your legs back right at the right moment she can do this to a tree and you will hit a resonant frequency of the tree and if you do this enough you can actually snapped in half and so yeah oh yeah I dunno what time it's funny how did you kill the tree watch this funding is with literally get physical physical pumping pumping system in a resonant frequency of the system itself the system wants to sway that rate if you put it in exactly that way you all that energy stays there and then a tree start blowing it waving in the breeze and and it's a sense of power over nature and I did this I could do it today so somebody's vocals court somebody's voice rings so you get it so you get an object that has a resonant frequency can be yes that up that a human voice can reach at a high enough volume and then it'll start vibrating ok if it's at the resonant frequency and if you can vibrate with enough energy at that frequency but glass is not going to be able to stay with you and you're just cracking good yeah yeah so that so that's a yes oh yeah yeah

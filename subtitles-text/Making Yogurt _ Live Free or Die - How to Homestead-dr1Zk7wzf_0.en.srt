yeah I really like making my own yogurt I have a quart of milk and I have some already made yogurt in this bowl and I have a pot so the first step is to take your quart of milk and put it into a pot I'm going to take this milk and going to warm it up just to where I start seeing some steam coming off of the milk so the next step is to put the milk back into the quart jar so I'm going to pour this for milk into the jar here and you want to fill it up until you have maybe a quarter cup of room left in there you're going to add three large tablespoons of culture to the warm quart of you can just buy some plain yogurt at the store just make sure you get play once the yogurt and the milk has been mixed together and put a lid on I like to do it loosely because as the fermentation is occurring air is going to be released I'm going to wrap it in this wool blanket if you have an oven you can put it in the oven on the one you wanted to stay from about 80 degrees 200 degrees it's becoming more and more common in our culture here in the mountains to make your own yogurt because a lot of people have their own milk and they have to find something to do with that not only last for so long and it's one way to waste a lot less food you can for metro milk of course the best part of yogurt is when it's finished and you get to eat it so I'm gonna have some now it's breakfast my favorite way to eat yogurt is with honey so I'm just going to drizzle a little honey on it or a lot of money this is my homemade yogurt and some honey from Mara from our honeybees it's one of my favorite

here's a rare sight in Hawaii an adult albatross on land the lays an albatross with a wingspan over six feet was boring 2 soul they're creatures of the wind living in the Scott and there's some powerful trade winds here in the Hawaiian Islands to keep them oft as long as they want they only return the land to raise their chicks the chicks are on a tight schedule in just a few months they have to develop the strength stamina and skill to take flight as you can see this is easier said than done the closer they get to adulthood the more pressure there is on them to fly the fledgling arrow knots turn into the wind and launch themselves down the beach death lurks for those who don't make the birds that aren't quite there were they have to plunk down in a gentle surf where tiger sharks are waiting for the young burnt rise with all its might to mimic its parents and get airborne yeah tiger sharks consume ten percent of all the Albatross young in this colony this drama plays out every year and the Sharks don't always win in fact sometimes the shark gives the Albatross the inspiration of life amazing what knowing you're about to be eaten can do for your motivation

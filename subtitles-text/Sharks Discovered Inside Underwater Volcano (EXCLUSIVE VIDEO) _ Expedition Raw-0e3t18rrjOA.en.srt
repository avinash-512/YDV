so we're in the Solomon Islands to study a submarine volcano called watching and it's dangerous little bit yeah absolutely we were scared karachi is usually erupting viewing like Baba when we went out it was not erupting free to kill for one of the girls so we're dropping this camera down primarily to take a closer look at the volcano the water's hot and specific its hostile enough the sea interesting biology it's just a bonus for you let me go get the data before I start getting too excited too carried away it comes to skype 30 oh yeah I wonder if that's his little came home thinking there you know that has the mug that circle like it like it was a hey something that shadow of something or something off the idea of there being large animals like sharks hanging out and living inside the caldera this volcano conflicts with what we know about ecology which is that interrupts but when it's there's no way anything could live in there and so the sea large animals like this that are living and potentially you know they could die at any moment it brings up lots of questions do they leave do they have some sort of sign that it's about to erupt  you know do they blow up sky-high a little bits and the fact that we saw animals in the plume like that that opens up all kinds of interesting that's the best project is to go out with one question and come back with many and that's exactly what happened

did you know there's a parasite called a jewel ones that can do brain surgery on its host its this wasp that injects venom into the brain of a cockroach as a cockroach is paralyzed if we use its stinger into the cockroaches brain feels around for the right part of its brain and that injects this specialized denim cocktail that actually removes the cockroaches ability to control its own behavior the muscles of the cockroach recover that it can no longer generate the will to move on its own so then the wasp takes the cockroach by the antenna and leads it to its burrow where then feeds it to its yell I think that's one of the cool stories I've heard in the natural world if you like tequila well guess what you always to the bats i'm here to convince you that that's are your best friends

so much i'm gonna call out some of these turkeys to go on a date with me and I'm working on my really it goes like this you sounded like a turkey spring and turkey hunting go hand-in-hand at the mountains of North Carolina homesteaders Tony and Amelia want to get in on the action I don't want to hunt since I was like 15 or something and this year we saw a bunch of turkey scratching everywhere at that world that's free food just hanging out and they want us to eat them we just assume that they wanted us to eat them I don't know maybe they didn't there's just one problem I've never hunted before this is all new for me and we need a shotgun so they're paying a visit to a neighbor who might be able to help no I know what dad's gonna be up to probably something horse-related my dad lives really close by on a small farm he's got horses and he's got some chickens good how you doing I'm gonna shoot holes of all kinds of okay i'm gonna guess one thing you will stop guys yeah we're gonna be serious now ok from here on in life serious about the gun cool anyway van seriously don't live there now it's a wacky zany character like me you know how to crank it up a notch there should be that's beautiful in a nice guy like a shotgun to nice pump shotgun this is the release for the pumps and never shot a shotgun before I never even shot a gun when you bring up your target ok you bring up the front bead first then you bring up the rear peace ok ok all right let's shoot a little bit nervous little concerned that the shotgun might blow me up so I'm really trying to avoid that you know mean forward just a little fire when ready Jesus Christ she's how Christ that one felt worse guy that blew a big old hole look at that I think you're wastin bullets on a static target turkeys don't sit around you know so are gonna do some moving targets we have a cardboard turkey and my dad has set up an elaborate pulley system where the turkeys going to go flying across this field looks like a turkey to me if I blow its head off gonna eat it ready to make the turkey fly I think I hit it hey that's impressive meant hit it on the first try to hook us up with the shotgun and i did a pretty good job that you say so myself whoa we're gonna eat this thing or what I was able to shoot that moving cardboard target and more confident now about hunting really doing this I got him right

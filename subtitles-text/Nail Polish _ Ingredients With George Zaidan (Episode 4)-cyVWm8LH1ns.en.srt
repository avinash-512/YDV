what's in here what does it do and can i make it from scratch it's the stuff inside your ingredients way back in the day nail polish is actually pretty simple the Egyptians used henna and the Chinese used a mixture of egg white beeswax gelatin vegetable dye this is a beat and gum arabic today we're talking about regular old nail polish which it turns out is neither regular nor that old anyway compared to the nail polish of the Ancients nail polish of today has a lot more ingredients because it has to do a lot more things first and foremost the color has to speak to some deep longing within your soul and second that color can't fade third you need to be able to brush it onto your nail evenly and smoothly fourth it needs to be thin enough to form a film without globbing but fifth it needs to be thick enough to not run everywhere six that needs to stick to your nail seven that needs to dry hard and glossy and keep that appearance ate that needs to be somewhat resistant to water and oil and whatever else might mess up your manicure nine that needs to avoid shipping and 10 that needs to dry somewhat quickly who that is a lot of stuff but basically we just want our nail polish to be easier and more convenient than what the Egyptians and Chinese used so let's break this down first up are the coloring agents or the pigments the pigments are really really really tiny particles that are suspended in the Polish now the pigments are fascinating and similar to what you might find in a lipstick we did a whole episode about this and i will post a link in the description then there are the solvents ethyl acetate and butyl acetate now chemically these guys are esters and they evaporate quickly and that's why you don't have to wait hours for your nail polish to dry incidentally most of that nail polish you smell esters next up is nitrocellulose which is a polymer that's made from cotton nitrocellulose is what forms that hard film on the outside of your nail and because of its ability to form these hard films it's used in varnishes for all kinds of stuff like playing cards or guitars in fact in the 1920s it was used as the base for a lot of car paints so today's cars use something different anyway nitrocellulose is also quick drying and pretty cheap but it actually doesn't stick to nails all that well and it's kind of brittle so manufacturers add other polymers like twosome I'd formaldehyde resin which is not formaldehyde to make your polish classier and stick better and actually if you see polly something something or something something copolymer on an ingredients label usually that polymers there to tweak the properties of the Polish in a way that makes sense for the particular type that you are buying then there's camper which comes from asian evergreen trees and chemically is a mix of terpenoids a camper is a plasticizer it's used to make the Polish a little bit more flexible and less likely to chip and you can actually see this if you take a thin layer of polish and peel it off some wax paper gently and if you look right there you can see it's kind of stretchy so far so good but there are still the conflicting requirements of being thin enough to paint an even coat and yet thick enough to not drip everywhere plus you want your pigments to be suspended in the Polish and not immediately settle down to the bottom now part of the way that manufacturers achieve all of these goals is by balancing the amounts of all the ingredients particularly the solvents polymers and pigments to get sort of in the ballpark of the right consistency but the other and chemically magical way is by using a molecule called sterile conium Hector I or its cousin sterile conium bentonite both of these guys come from clay and they have this weird but awesome property where solutions of them if they're just sitting there will be thick or gel like but the second you apply a force like for example brushing them onto your nail they get in a lot of foods actually have this property like ketchup does for example if you're interested check out the links i will post a description no check out the description i'll post a link and finally there's benzophenone one which chemically is similar to the active ingredients in sunscreen turns out the sunscreen is not there for you or your nails it's actually there to protect color UV light from the Sun can actually degrade colors in nail polish so benzophenone one keeps them from fading this point you're probably wondering how the hell am I gonna make me I'll polish from natural or even remotely natural ingredients after all most homemade nail polish homemade is actually just adding pigments to a premade clear base so I just quit what's on this one I'm going to go back to basics all the way back to the Chinese recipe which actually is not even a recipe it's just a list of ingredients specifically egg-white gelatin beeswax gum arabic and vegetable dyes in this case beats that i blended and then strained through a coffee filter now looking at these ingredients you would think they are nothing like what goes into a modern nail polish but chemically they're actually not that so gum arabic is a resin like nitrocellulose or to solemnize formaldehyde resin it helps form films egg-white that's mostly protein and water but also probably helps form films along with the gum arabic gelatin is a thickener just like stereo podium Hector right and beeswax is a plasticizer like camper so when you look at it like this really the biggest difference between ancient polishes and modern ones is that the ancient polishes did not have quickly evaporating solvents but that's okay i'm sure we'll figure something out so let's try this so because this is a list of ingredients and not an actual recipe i just made one up i'm using components from jelly and custard recipes so we'll see what happens okay so there we go nail polish I think that's been sitting for a while and now it's ready to test want to take my cue tip dip it in here and a nice amount of color first test doesn't really drip so we're doing good actually that is really good it's not dripping at all so passes the first test kinda liquidy alright too liquidy it's pulling all over my mail and I can actually see some stuff that's not dissolve that's probably gonna Arabic but i am going to keep painting anyway and maybe if I just leave it long enough and then blow-dry it something good will happen I who knows ok so this is not coming off on my finger when it's dry which is a great sign it is kind of chunky which doesn't feel that great but it kind of reflects light in a weird and interesting way which I don't hate now the real test is will this come off underwater and there is only one way to find out here's some water let's do this just gently rubbing it is definitely coming off we just like be die it is water-soluble this is absolutely coming off so basically you will be fine until you went to wash your hands so i give this overall three out of 10 I mean it's not zero it painted my nail but it's basically useless i might as well just take a beat died and put that on my nails if you guys have any ideas on how to improve this recipe please let me know in the comments or hit me up on Twitter all right

yeah long walk on a cold day I've learned about injuries is listen to your body your body is hurt and it's trying to tell you some in this case right here this lake is trying to tell me not to use it this could take it easy take one step at a time eventually I'll get back even if i get back slowly it's good to be home that's not get inside take my clothes off get some rest hurts even just take my boots off and off if you can't walk on snowshoes you basically can't walk out here this time here can't get around oh it's definitely swollen right in this area I think I'm having a problem with the tendons that they became a flame because of overuse I was snowshoeing so much so I'm gonna try heat and cold I don't get injured very often but when I have a problem like this have to take care of it myself I can't make a trip to the doctor's office as its 200 miles down to Fairbanks cost four thousand dollars to go there just give it time and have patience your body will heal itself eventually most things that happen to you that's all I can do is just wait treated as best i can see what happens

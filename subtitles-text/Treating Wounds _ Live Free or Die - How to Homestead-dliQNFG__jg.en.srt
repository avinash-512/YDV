it's always a good idea when you get done working with any of while meet to check and see if you're getting Nick's or scratches this is a very minor a nicker scratch but just a little one like that can get infected and turned something pretty serious so what I do is the time this recipe for any kind of a small flash would your injury is simply poor little turpentine on it last virtually forever and it will kill the fungus bacteria and algae keep it from getting it helps your body heal itself and even a small amount taken internally does no major damage i want to use a lot of it it also penetrate penetrate into the skin for some reason it penetrates tissue and heels even internally that way it's my magic this is my number one medicine

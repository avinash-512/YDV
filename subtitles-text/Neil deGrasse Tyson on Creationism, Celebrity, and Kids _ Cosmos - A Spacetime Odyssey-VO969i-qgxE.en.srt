the real problem in society is not whether we're teaching our kids enough science because let's say we started that tomorrow does that mean everything's okay if we teach the thirteen-year-old better STEM education have a better stem teacher by going to wait 40 years for that kid to become president so it and/or member of Congress so that we now have a scientifically literate country no i'm not i'm not that patient for me the real challenge the real problem are scientifically illiterate adults adults are in charge there five times as many adults as there are kids in this country adults wheel resources adults vote will tell me let's fix the kids and everything will be fine fix the adults then the kids will be fine my field astrophysics may be at this point the only academic field wear what i do is not count against me at worst it's just neutral many other fields of science spending your time that you might have been in the lab talking to the public going on nighttime talk shows going on comedic nighttime talk shows is viewed head as a as a as a as a violation of the contract between you and your lab experiment I carry two titles on a research associate in our department of astrophysics at the American Museum of Natural History in New York i'm also director of the Hayden Planetarium and in that capacity is fully expected by everyone around that I would be talking to the public but more important carl sagan basically did this first there are spotty examples that preceded him but he did it in the biggest most significant way and he cleared the field and there's blood on that field he was not warmly received by these activities what you're gonna be on The Tonight Show that's isn't that comedy but you're a scientist maybe you're not a serious scientist then there's scientific cultural pressure against it at the time but then what do we notice in my field that members of Congress would be ready to vote on some budget and say wait a minute isn't that on a space mission that I've heard about I saw Carl Sagan talk about that is that what you might you're my constituents that what you're telling ya oh my gosh let's do it and all of a sudden the tide waters rose for science funding members of Congress came to embrace the methods and tools of science and the fruits of its discovery if you feel strongly about your religious philosophies I will have nothing to say about it unless you want to change the curriculum in a science classroom and i would ask you I won't fight you i will ask you why there's no tradition of scientists knocking down the sunday-school door telling the preacher what to teach that is never a theist don't even do that there's no scientist ratings picketing outside of your church so that or synagogue or mosque and that might not necessarily be true there is no such tradition so what is the motivation to try to take a religious philosophy and influence what goes on in science you can get up enough people to influence school board ok again I'm an educator i'm here to tell you the consequence of that if you substitute religious philosophy for science there will be a generation of people who will not understand what science is and they will be intellectually crippled from contributing to what the centuries have demonstrated to be the most efficient engine of economic growth that has ever been devised and that is innovations in science and technology

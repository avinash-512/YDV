yeah I'm going to make this home for the night and i'm going to do a little bit of fire straightening so I'm just warming the dark over the coals on this fire and then Travis kind of straighten it for days into his 80-mile journey desert Nomad Tobias is suffering the consequences of a lack of food I just feel kind of tired right now tired and hungry with loan miles and days ahead pretty good to buy it shifts his focus to hunting wild game is only potential source of protein this journey out here like a test to see if i can use what I know and learn new things and just not die I'm just trying to create kind of a little divot here that the thrower will hook into a bigger question is like as humans are we still capable of living in the environment that we evolved in brought a couple wild turkey feathers for watching it seems almost unfathomable to come live like this but I'm here because I want to consciously do things in a different way working the end down so that i can get one of the bullet shells that I found to fit on the end of this really durable hard blunt tip I always knew is going to be a big challenge but in the end I don't want to be out here just to suffer just a quick and dirty I'm interested in living a life worth living hopefully catching some meet tomorrow

how would you rather go extinct starvation Spears or syphilis the Rapa Nui had all three hey guys Amy with you on dnews today it's been long thought that the original people of Easter Island killed themselves off through war but new information is suggesting otherwise Easter Island the 64 square mile remote chili and territory that lives over 2,300 miles off the South American coast is known to most of us as that island with a giant heads called moai these statues of human figures with oversized heads were made by the Rapa Nui the island native polynesian inhabitants at some point between the tenth and sixteenth centuries but not long after erecting the impressive statues the Rapa Nui disappeared and four years archaeologists have suspected that they were killed off by an environmental catastrophe they brought upon themselves the commonly held areas that humans and what miraculously reach the small island more than a millennium ago and quickly colonized it but with these new residents also came rats which they either brought as a food source or stowaways in any case these rats thrived on the isolated volcanic island finding an ample food supply in the lush palm trees and with no risk of starvation the population quickly swelled to a few million the rats ate the vegetation faster than it could regrow eventually taking away their own food supply less rat food meant less rats and les rats meant less food for the humans tack on the fact that the local people were also cutting down vegetation for farmland and building materials and you have an island that is no longer environmentally sustainable again meaning less food for those that didn't die from starvation went to war over the dwindling food supply kill each other with the many arrowheads archaeologists have found scattered around the island by the time the European explorers reached the island in 1722 there are a few natives left those that remained were quickly killed by Western diseases like syphilis and smallpox the Europeans brought with them this theory on Easter Island history is so prevalent that historians use it as a cautionary tale of the perils that come from abusing the scant natural resources available in a small environment but new research is challenging this long-held theory archaeologists continued field work on the remote island now suggests that disease and slavery brought by Europeans played a much larger role in killing the Rapa Nui than their environmental demise the findings published in the journal antiquity . to one specific thing do you remember when I talked about those arrowheads the Rapa Nui used to kill each other well it turns out they aren't arrowheads at all they're not even weapons those carved sharp-pointed pieces of obsidian a rock made a volcanic glass are called ma and after analyzing 423 of them a team of scientists is now determined that the objects aren't suited for killing humans are more suited to be a general purpose tool they could have been used for anything from cultivating the land to ritual scarification to tattooing as lead author on the recent study kar lipo of the Binghamton University in New York explain to the BBC a weapon would be long and thin like a sword basically something prime for piercing in Oregon without having to get too close to an enemy the points on Easter Island are just too short and flat there are more reminiscent of spades and a spear making them tools for survival like digging and farming so the Rapa Nui didn't kill themselves that shifts the blame firmly onto the European well rats eating the palm trees and the Rapa Nui felling them to clear the land and make fires would have changed the it seems the environment remained sustainable for century it wasn't until the Europeans brought diseases and enslave the native Islanders that they were put on the road to near extinction so the Rapa Nui might be gone but at least we can rebuild their history through rich archaeological analysis but analyzing pointed stones isn't the only way scientists are recovering lost civilizations Julian's got the skinny on how scientists are using lidar to unveil lost cities lidar is like radar except instead of using radio waves reflected off objects to find them it uses lasers and as it turns out these lasers are perfect for penetrating dense vegetation and if you want to keep updated on all things science be sure to check out test tubes newsletter get a weekly roundup of our most popular videos across all our shows a test tube . com / FWD what mysteries of ancient civilizations would you guys like to know more about let us know in the comments below and don't forget subscribe for more dnews every day of the week  yeah

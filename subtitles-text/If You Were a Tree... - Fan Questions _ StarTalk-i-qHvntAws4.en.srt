I want to be planted in a wide open meadow so that everyone of my branches can receive all the sunlight and once I don't have to compete for the photons from the Sun which is what goes on daily hourly in forest specially rainforest where there's the canopy and then everything else below has to be able to live without direct sunlight and the branches of the trees that keep reaching for the canopy those branches that are below they drop dead because there's no some way to sustain them I don't want to be just one of it just leaves on the top I want full plumage wanna be old and wise in the middle of a matter and there's nothing more beautiful than a solitary tree in the middle of a field it invites you to sit under it and have people come sit under my branches and added dimension of romance to their lives under the branches my tree one risk however if your tree in the middle of a meadow in the middle of a field is that you will get hit by lightning lightning does not like moving through air and if you reaching up in the air it's going to go through basically your wet bark the lightning will pass through your wet bark and before it connects the cloud to the ground but maybe that's worth it so that all the time until I'm struck by lightning amputate one of my limbs I think it'll be worth it up to that moment for having a completely image as an ornament in the centre of midfield

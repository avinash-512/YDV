this first question is from mr. often via Twitter he says made your hair it's grace thank you he says it's something like Tony stack sack reactor possible arc reactor this is the thing this chest here's my take on it if you're producing that much energy in such a small place either his chest or in some energy generating place in his building as much energy as that is you're going to be creating heat fundamental laws of thermodynamics would indicate this and that heat would melt everything vaporize everything one of the great challenges of localizing energy and then distributing it where you need this is the big challenge of of power plants nucare up any kind of power . they all need coolant and if you're gonna make it we gotta make it as it's being used because it's really hard to store without melting where you store it so there's some laws of thermodynamics acting against it yeah that I but I'd like I love it though and I love me some Tony Stark because he's a superhero with his ingenuity right with his technology with his technology you've got to pick somebody I would pick him as my favorite me Tommy to over Batman to combat the both you man they're both human yeah well with use technological exoskeleton XO yeah yeah totally i think yeah I think they're the most appropriate to who we are exactly i agree I agree

the night sky can inspire you on many many levels most people's concept of God has their God residing in the sky not under their feet in the dirt there's a deep sense that was above us is greater than us bigger than us more powerful than us CCB deepen our DNA I don't know other animals that that gaze upwards and I wondered could it be for example that most four-legged mammals are looking down looking for food looking up is just what are you gonna do that right when is that arise tonight they're asleep but you know we sleep at night as well however we are perfectly comfortable sleeping on our backs most animals in the entire animal kingdom insects included will never find themselves on their back never ever we're perfectly fine sleeping on her bed at night and what happens when you wake up gotta go pee in the bushes you wake up at night and you're on your back the sky is there for you to behold I think the sky's a fundamental part of our life experience add to this modern scientific knowledge that stars are born live out their lives and I some of them explode and those that exploded manufacture the elements from the periodic table of elements that comprise life as we know it and the more knowledge you have of the universe the more majestic it is and the more connected to you or to it it's not we're here and that's there is that we're here that's there but our atoms and molecules were once there and now they're here so there's a kinship with the consequence that modern science has revealed to us so I would claim no matter how you slice the question what does it mean to look up no matter who answers that question they gonna tell you they're looking up is something beautiful something profound something deep in more ways than one it contains our destiny

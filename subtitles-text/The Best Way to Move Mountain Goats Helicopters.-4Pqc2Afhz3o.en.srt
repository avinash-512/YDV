so the way we catch goats we don't tranquilize them at all they just what they do is they take a helicopter and they fly until they find a goat and they can have it in an area that's relatively flat they can catch it and they shoot a net out of a neck done which basically in the angles the animal then they have what's called a mother get out and mobilize the animal they put hobbles on its legs so it can't kick the blindfolded so it can't see them to put the animal in a bag sling it needs the helicopter back to the staging area for process yeah now the reason we net is that the others the different options that you can do wanted to try to trap them but now i have country be very difficult if we tranquilize usually it takes at least five minutes before that dart work so they could really run anywhere off a cliff just get the spot where you want to do wait physical examination come in you take some samples or health surveillance and we completely injuries and treat them and we just issue of the animals are treated the way they should be we'll do some ultrasound measurements from a take some other various measurements on the and the radio collar on it and then take it and put it into a box where it will be transported to a different unit and least since

what's in here what's it do and can i make it from scratch it's the stuff inside your ingredients you can think of lipstick as a slightly more complicated crown crayons are made of waxes and colors and lipsticks have waxes and colors in them too but if you've ever tried drawing on your face with a crayon you'll find that doesn't really work the way you'd like because crayons are hard because they need to write on a hard surface whereas lipsticks have to be soft because your lips are soft so in addition to the waxes and colors they also contain oils and a bunch of other stuff depending on exactly what type of lipstick you buy but what I really want to talk about is the reason you buy lipstick in the first place and that is its color cochin eel is a scale insect that feeds on prickly pear plants and it was used to make died in South America hundreds of years ago these bugs produce a chemical called carminic acid which is this brilliant red color to get the dye out of the bugs you killa specifically you kill the pregnant females because that's where the diet and it takes about ninety thousand or so bugs to make one kilogram of dry coach Neil powder today we still use coach Neil to color not just lipsticks but also foods look for coach Neil extract or carmine which is made from carminic acid on ingredients label so at this point you might be wondering why do we use bugs to color food I mean ideally wouldn't we just make all of our colors in a lab somewhere actually that is mostly what happens these days but it turns out that many of the brilliant non-white non-black colors are chemically really hard to make so for most of human history we've had to rely on nature to do all the complicated chemistry of color making for us hence the grinding up of bugs now once chemist started being able to make Reds like carmine in a lab the use of bug juice went way down although it's been enjoying a bit of a resurgence lately because people have been asking for all natural ingredients go figure now if you look at the ingredients of lipstick you'll see that there's usually more than one color ingredient and typically these color ingredients are described both by a regular english name like and seven lake or by a color index or CI number and this number can sometimes tell you more than you think like a secret code so for example any number starting with 75 that is a natural color so car- 75 470 any number starting with 77 that's an inorganic compound which is basically something that doesn't have carbon atoms titanium dioxide which is white and mixed with red to make pink lipstick is 7789 one and then there's 774 91 92 $STREET and 99 which are slightly different versions of iron oxide also known as rust yep sometimes the rust red color of your favorite lipstick is literally rust so now that we know it's in lipstick and how it works i'm going to try and make my own from scratch using natural ingredients starting with rust as my homemade lipstick colorant and i'm going to use mica for some glitter and shine and micah comes from granite and other rocks and this stuff is the best glitter bomb material i have ever seen it gets everywhere and never comes out so use that information wisely as for my waxes I've got beeswax which comes from bees and paraffin wax which comes from crude oil as for the oils I've got canola oil and coconut I'm just going to assume that the rest of the stuff and lipstick doesn't matter all that much so we'll see how right or wrong I am ok time to pour this into a lipstick mold well so much for that idea now we let this hardened let's try it I made a bit of a mess of things but here's the mold I'm just gonna pop it open wait wait here comes haha ok the moment 4 30 have to say that's actually the first time I've ever done that so let me get my mirror here and seek bottle o worker that's an exiting hey not bad i really sort of really get ok so we did it we did it we made lipstick I mm I can't tell though if it's really glittery the red the iron definitely worked but I don't know if it shimmers as much as I wanted it to it's possible that the mica settled to the bottom of the mold while it was still cooling and the way to fix that would be to use even more finely divided Micah but i would give this i would give this give this a nine out of ten and a half and half a so if you guys have ideas on how to improve this recipe let me know in the comments or hit me up on Twitter and if you have an idea for episode let me know as

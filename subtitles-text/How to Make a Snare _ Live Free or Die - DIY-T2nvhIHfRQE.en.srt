you're planning on kitchen animal one of the simplest kind of traps that you can build is a snare you can make it out of a fine a piece of cordage strength is a piece of electrical plant scored now I don't have electricity so I don't have appliances but you find this stuff in the trash in dumpsters pretty easy to take this stuff apart what you want to do is take the rubber cord off of it you just grab one in and get some friction and called the rubber all favorite i'm simply going to trim it off with the edge of my knife now my next step is deciding how many strands I need and they're not twisted very tightly so i can just pull them apart what I want to do with it now is twist it back together I just need to twist it one way just enough to make it hold what I want is a slip knot on the end of it but I'd like a slipknot that locks the simplest way that i found is simply tie a loop that's doubled what you thi luc that's doubled it is kind of a small as possible and twist it together what you have then there's a little tiny loop the way this works is once you put the other end it when I pull it tight it will tend to group itself then I've get the snare wire going to make a loop about the right size for my target animal the target animals going to be a rabbit this is a red me when he walks with his ears back he's about the size of my fist like this I want him to squeeze through easily and as he pulls through simply slides around his neck anchor the snare to something solid this small tree should hold now what I've got to do next to figure out how are their rabbits head is off the ground so I need that about right there what I found is the best way to hold it in place where you want it is to simply wrap your snare around a stick then I'll shove that in the ground so now i have a rabbit trail with a piece of copper wire coming across it looks totally natural it worked for a day a week even a year all i gotta do is come by and check it so rabbits going from garden garden in the neighborhood just walking along you done man there's a nice-lookin garden over there I think those people at work today well this is great i'm going to check out their lettuce oh I can get through that no problem at all man I can't reach that and at night they will have a rabbit lean right there ready to go with your vegetables rabbit student

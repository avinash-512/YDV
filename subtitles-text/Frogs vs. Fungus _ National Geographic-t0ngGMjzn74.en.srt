hmm hmmm Golden Frog Panama is more to the small Central American country's culture people here have long treasured is colorful and Fabian considering a symbol of good luck prosperity but today panama's frogs are under siege both six or seven years when I came here first time we have to we have to what's our staff because there were so many balls in frocks around it we we actually have to be careful guess we didn't want to step on the froth and now finance we all have San Juan for ok here on embrose 30 minutes so what's happening it seems there's a dangerous predator on the prowl in the form of a naturally occurring fungus culture tree and it's spreading like a black flag over this majestic land killing almost every species of frog in its path eventually its still the cells from the skin approx cell after a while the frock will try to get rid of the Kiffin by producing more skin which cause that this can have a frog gets speaker and then because I've that the fraction rich through the skin band eventually for actual die of suffocation in an effort to save this treasure species the Houston Zoo has put panamanian biologist Edgardo chris has to work he and his team a rounding up every frog they can find in the ovine the region's an imam the frogs have taken up residence at the hotel competitor into rented rooms the researchers have converted into laps I tell with the owner on the matter you up a hotel confessor I don't think that they had an hour idea of what was actually gonna happen at does hotel rooms guess to have those hotel rooms we we change it with to call the bats out on all the furniture for the hotel and we with Jess a lot of salve and and a lot of readers keeper of the disease can be successfully treated but only if it's caught in the early stages and the frogs can never returned to the wild the race to save what's left of them can only be described as and organize panic said some 120 of Central America's and Fabian species are believed to have gone extinct Picasa the fungus since 1980 once they get to hotel room  they goes in today a quarantine safe section that would put them in a clean room and in that room we have to keep taking care of them my keeping this many frogs a life also requires a steady supply of live insects and one bug is not as good as the next for these and Fabian's appetites the Golden Frog spur for termites by day while other species enjoy various sizes of crickets finite and we come back Evo 302 400 that Trichet's every night attic day goes from happen that changed to prolly 45 the changes the whole process takes up to six hours each night from collecting going back to the hotel to feed more than 250 hungry inhabitants I mean when you grab them immediately they will try to bite you so we a symbol of for that but just eat cat after feel more safe this crazy yessss crazy I got 89 so I just need to anymore get my polls space is limited so new artificial home is being constructed at the nearby on these perot soon researchers have high hopes for breeding the frogs and releasing them back to the wild but Mark until a solution to the checkered problem is found one of my goals is to have a very good yeah successful have reading program hoping that we can figure out a way housing great missus tens or to fight the promise into why a unfortunately even at the researchers find a way to reduce or even eliminate the threat of children the Golden Frog and will still have to survive other phones them was a the illegal for actors find out that a string like this where have for our fill come basically every week its is a very illegal thing did that before keep doing Evan when kit for this killing the props and then another reason why they are not that at the end and as a habitat loss i mean they're getting it attack from every skies from the top from the bottom from the water from the sky from everywhere and the kids read yes came to you finish damn p it may be a long time before the forced to see for golden frogs but with the conservation effort to the and biologists like a guard aggressive the last to panama's may still have a fighting chance sponsored by the my wonderful world campaign join us today and help get kids the power global knowledge sponsored by National Geographic mission programs taking science and exploration into the new millennium sign up now at my wonderful world %ah toward and receive our free newsletter in resources join more than 80,000 people and lend your voice to call for better geography education because kids to understand our world today can succeed in tomorrow

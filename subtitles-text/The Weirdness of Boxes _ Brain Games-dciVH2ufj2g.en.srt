we've placed wait inside of each of these boxes we asked our volunteers without peeking to tell us which is heavier that one seems to have here definitely yeah definitely this is later yeah this one feels a little bit heavier which i thought would be lighter but it's not think my job huh ok so when you had just looked at the boxes when you just look at the size which one did you think would be heavier I guess this one because it was just so big so its bigger yeah initially you're going to think bigger means heavier yeah i was saying the same thing too turns out this game requires more than just your sense of sight and touch your brain also relies on motor learning the kind of muscle memory super sense to gauge the way to the so which box is really heavier bring that one over here and then read the reading from the scale in pounds 14 pounds 14 pounds yeah alright so now we know the lighter boxes using let's bring in the heavier box of your box right wait plate what does it say 14 pounds were voicing time it's the same exact thing but we we really yeah how does that even work though like why well when you first pick up the box you have this expectation that the larger one will be heavier and so you apply more force than you need and that makes it wind up feeling lighter in a way but you lifted it multiple times and you moved it around and you really developed an internal model of what the wait was in other words your motor sensing system figured it out it knows that it requires the same force to lift each box but the cognitive perceptual part of your brain refuses to accept that conclusion so it's still thinks that the smaller box is heavier what does that tell you about your brain it has lied to me I do not trust anything anymore ever we live in the matrix oh god no

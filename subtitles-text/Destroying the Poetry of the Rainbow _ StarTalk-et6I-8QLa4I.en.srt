he thought that Newton was destroying the poetry of the rainbow by explaining respectful completely destroying the mystery of it display Ministry of it and and the the message of my book is that you don't by destroying the mystery you increase the poetry you don't you don't decrease and I try to go there in all of my work whether or not i succeed that's not my intent I think there's no more reproduced image when people want you to think of God than a sunset with beams of light coming out but I also know that the surface of the sun of 6,000 degrees and Israeli scattering the atmosphere you have water droplets condensing to make clouds and exact so where do you differ from this maybe I go a little bit further in the direction of good-natured ridicule of absurd ideas like astrology you're saying it's good natured but clearly the people who are who are the on the other side of your wit and intelligence i would are they saying you're being good-natured possibly not i don't i don't really care about that I'm awesome ok now I mean I feel stupid next to you now I and I know all this stuff alright so come on and I i have an eye to not just the astrologer that i'm talking to her but the example the radio audience whatever it is that that are that are listening in if you call somebody an idiot you're not going to change his mind but you may change the minds of a thousand people yeah so let me ask you something but just flat-out sure that out I don't have a problem if people feel spiritually when they contemplate the cosmos and I may even feel some of that as well i'm really talking about as religion manifests in the world the whole other portfolio of things you're supposed to do the rituals that derive from it the rules that come down from revealed text that's a whole other conversation then telling me that I'm experiencing an open door to God when i'm on a mountaintop I think those are two different things I think God and we're watchin I I don't believe you you see those two different things but most people who are vocal and active and politically motivated do not but why should that keep you from God i mean if if you have an experience of God why should all the other stuff that that distracts you keep you from that I mean like saying you know I ran into a guy i took a terrible course and in science wants and all the teachers were terrible what does that mean you don't believe in science anymore no it means you don't believe or you haven't had a good experience of the other things of the human element of it so I what I dancing is which God are you Zeus that I'm coming closer to because i am on the mountaintop where Zeus lib Molly did come out of his head right so so maybe there's a particular God that you would rather it be than other gods that have come before people of of the past but I also know that throughout most of the history of science some of the greatest scientists have ever lived have been deeply religious themselves

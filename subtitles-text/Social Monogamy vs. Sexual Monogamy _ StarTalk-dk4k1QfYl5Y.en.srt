we are not a naturally monogamous species we are a pair bonding species but there's social monogamy which is the paramount and their sexual monogamy which is never touching anybody ever get with your generals and we are not exactly that before no we need to split it we all of these birds we used to look to and think why can't we be monogamous like we're like the eagles and then yeah certain case and little birds that would make it would make for life with and we would measure our failure as humans to live up to the standards set by these damn birds along comes genetic testing and we find out that these birds are screwing around on each other constantly that they are socially monogamous pair-bonded but they're not section i was no primates with testicles are size are are monogamous sexually monogamous women hidden mensis i'm not saying all this to say that people shouldn't go from monogamy monogamy something they want i'm not saying this to argue that people have made a monogamous commitment have license to violate that monogamous commitment and of course that's what headlines would do when they hear phrases right out of your mouth and they do what I'm saying is we are not naturally monogamous it is a difficult struggle for us Chris Ryan sex writer uh in his books exit on before you just know all these sex writers well i did i read them all he points out that you know all these cultures you know the disc I religions death penalty for adultery well the same time we run around arguing that monogamy comes naturally to us as a species well no other species has to be threatened with death to do that which comes naturally to it we don't point guns at dolphins and they swim right but we point guns at each other and say don't cheat because monogamy comes naturally to us and so I'm not my argument that isn't you shouldn't have it you shouldn't do it my argument is we should be a little compassion understanding about the fact that monogamy is a struggle that a monogamous we we said we believe we told us children is one day you will grow up and fall in love with someone and you will make a monogamous commitment to them and that means you're in love with them and when you're in love you won't want to have sex with other people and the truth is if you make a monogamous commitment to someone you love you will still want to have sex with other people you will refrain from it it will be difficult and so perhaps we need to look at people who have been in 50-year marriages and only cheated on each other once twice and say they were good at monogamy not bad at it good at it and give them some credit for having done this thing that was difficult in natural as a token of their love and affection and commitment almost completely successfully protected like look somebody standing on one foot for 50 years that's kind of amazing if they touch the ground two or three times to get their balance we wouldn't go they sucked it standing on their foot for 50 years I want

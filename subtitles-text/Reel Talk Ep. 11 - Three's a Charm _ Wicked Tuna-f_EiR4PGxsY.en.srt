we get to know real talk you just watch the newest episode of wicked tuna and now it's time for wicked tuna real talk we're in England's most wicked bluefin captain share their thoughts on the latest episodes my name is mike so happy to be your host once again joining us this week we've got three of the best captain TJ on the Hot Tuna captain Tyler McLaughlin a pinwheel and Captain Paul Ebert of the Kellyanne guys thank you all for being with me what a week efficient it was hot too and i have its best trip this season landing three fish pinwheels deck and travis browne constituted by himself last week a very frustrated Tyler push Travis to the ground in the middle of a fish fight it wasn't clear if Travis was gonna stick around Tyler easy only guy you've got right now how worried were you that he wasn't gonna come back but really not that worried about it because I don't get it done by myself getting the day there's like 20 kids pounding on the boat on the dock ready to go for humble 40 minutes come on any services that he did you good little credit one more how did I don't think I didn't give him credit I was so stoked to Travis got this fishing he did everyone says you know open with those two mates that I don't know it's because I've been looking for the right one and i finally found the right one but you have to be at least a little nervous that after you shoved the kid he wasn't gonna come back a little bit but I mean at the same time you know I knew like where his head was and where's mentality wasn't like you kind of yeah there's gonna be ups and downs there's times when I work for TJ where I wanted to get off the boat and what I see you stay on it wednesday fishing used to beg me to go do that many times as you want to release dr. I was pretty upset i don't know how i am using quit school lie to me go fishing again already that's great dad alright well look we weren't sure whether or not Travis was gonna come back he seems a little bit unsure as to whether or not he truly wanted to we know Tyler apologized at least kind of let's relive what happened prior how you doing man you ready to fish today or what I guess so hopefully uh hopefully have a better trip in last time more fish unless it's very hard for me to apologize to Travis because there's a captain what I did was not wrong because we caught the fish I gotta go back to having fun and like loving what i'm doing and doing this without pressure did we do this because it's a passion you gotta have fun while you do what you want to go i'm gonna be miserable the whole time you don't mean mean old salty that's what I'm gonna call you from now on you stick with me ride this adam telling you I'm gonna lead to the promised land catch a lot attendants yeah it don't let it happen again don't push me push you back right DJ Paul start with you TJ does that count as a as a proper apology i understand x position you know he wants to the kids to know that he's the captain so he doesn't want to come off too easy on Paul would you think of the development of talent and the need to apologize there i think the kids amazing for someone like that to come back i mean i want you guys been friends not that long I remember 45 minutes in ocean city is that you want to get ready but he has got it you know few people like that he's leaving you with his age just starting actually when I was to change doing as I Sandro there's not many obvious so you should be lucky to have I don't think Talan wants to have too much though not be able to know what that's like this and you can have it when you earn it but they come on when I got on your boat is to think I was like unstoppable when you broke me down and maybe starting off at the bottom and then you make built me up Thailand decides that hard on you you're pretty horny manual Hollywood pretty hard on me that's kind of the interesting dynamic me however you wanted yeah that's the same thing you know when Travis thinks you know it doesn't stink you know he's got to work his way up in the realm he's got to earn it you guys have all actually worked for each other right all you've been on TJ's bhopal you work for Tyler when you guys were in North Carolina together okay so what would you have done if Tyler and pushed you at that point knocked him out and I don't think I went too far like I wanted to not real 420 . push down and Tyler how would you react if TJ push you back in the day I probably end up overboard so i would try to get back into but it was just like in the spare of the moment on the fish he wanted another travel didn't mean to god he's turned the wrong way and I just want to position the boat is also just get out of the way I still move the boat because official circle he's going to get cut off by the runner if we move the boat so ultimately we did see you let him go he was sleeping you said hey we need bait you took off left him alone with the let's all see what happens definitely marketing one where are you Tyler going to be found oh man it's great they're catching bait i'm catching students I can't lose this thing now and so close to catching gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta got him it seemed like kind of a test for him at this point how do you think he did with his test he couldn't pass that much better than that he passed with flying colors are getting straight A's across-the-board I'm proud of him he did exactly what I expected I expected to come back i had no idea was going to come back to be an 80-inch hanging outside but I expected balloons to be out must be actively fishing and I was going to be happy with that just to see the tuna fish makes me proud of the fact that he can get it done not get off the anchor and be by himself just shows you the caliber fisherman he did really made me proud that day you know he pretty much anchored himself on board depending on the issue here was bait though is he supposed to be fishing for bait first or did you get instant rebate at night but he decided to take a little bit of a nap you missed the window to catch baby so I had to go try and salvage some bait out deep water but you know we did have a few Bates we just didn't have enough you know to get through the day TJ you got a couple of guys on your boat would you would you ever leave them i mean yeah i could trust shared Michael for sure i know i could i mean i think that was amazing with the kids that personnel on there well I'm grateful you've been with for a while they just said you don't even have to say it they instinctively know if you are off of ya lookin for bait and bait goes by they're going to run in grab rod you don't tell them anything they just know w seem pretty darn happy when you hear back to the boat you see the 80 inch tuna hanging off the side how surprised were you though I'm super surprised he's like at first I'd like you know some people talking the radio that there was something going on my boat and I don't know what's happening I thought maybe he just couldn't find me or something that I fell overboard didn't get my note I don't know what happened but when I came back and I saw the fish are stoked because that's a good thing for someone have happened in their life I mean catch a bluefin by yourself he not get online and dead body especially greenhouse doing this is very impressive man that's getting kids just one week removed from getting thrown to you know he's he's gotta back ringer on my vote there's no doubt about my imagined when I when we were first watching this that we were going to see him not get the note was going to be like some like backwards comedy like a Charlie Chaplin comedy and he's looking around friend he heads into town because he figures you're dead and they call the Coast Guard or something so I was glad to see always well that ended well I was just happy that you know he did what he needed to do is a fisherman and he took initiative to calculate the big things away initiative to put the bait so did you catch any bait while you're out there yeah we came back with bait but didn't really didn't eat it yet it needed about you know we need to get the rest of the trip was good how hard is it to catch that fish solo to you I mean you got you got four guys with you most of the time well I won't let me anywhere anytime you get your fish by yourself it's it's a huge accomplishment but i think it's even more so in this case because he's a greenhorn yeah I'm saying you need to be having choices that can totally throw a harpoon or get a fish out of that size probably only one with tyler this year so for him to pull that off I mean it's really impressive i think the kid I've been a good when I wanna change religions all you I mean I know like I'm and whatnot but like seriously like I like trying to make them understand what we're doing because the easier it is for me to make him so he understands what we're doing the easier it is on my back that's what you don't know see Jerry he's great and all but I've yelled at him I've screens i throw him to the ground to just like that you have to teaching my that's a total lie I didn't think that's all nothing about that sunday and our like this and I'm sure you and Jared have had your times out there man course also this week we saw Hot Tuna have its best fishing trip so far this season the guys landed three fish out on fippennies ledge earn more than 14 thousand dollars it was a very different story though onboard fishing vessel tuna.com with the guys were struggling all week on Stellwagen bank and one . we saw . com gave even sharing his frustration with TJ over the radio and right in the middle of the conversation Hot Tuna hooks up with their second fish let's check it out you see you around wow that he's on a better life than I yeah Harvey certainly build a four-day right now but there's nothing more important than for the Hot Tuna the land mr. he just got it against you also got done talking I gotta get you know get you don't get it yeah come on let's go make it yes yes we need that all right well Tyler obviously you and Dave had quite the history this year we saw the fight back at the docks of how do you react when you see him frustrated like that little extra sense of satisfaction yeah it totally you know commerce starting to bite him in the ass and it's deserving and I'm glad that he's struggling and I hope it continues to struggle douchebag com 000 black but thinks he's perfect he thinks he's mr. perfection in to see him struggle is a good thing and TJ on the other hand it was about as good as it gets for your however houses are you literally only warning I felt like actually was doing for a second which is amazing it you know blind squirrel finds in that we just happen to find three that day so let's see beyond that I mean in the past sometimes you see a lot of chaos on your boat is the tunas on its way and it felt like you guys are a little more harm ya what take my boat to is what you really can't see times it's very high off the water and you know we fish have your line so we get the fish up a lot of times they're green and you really have to reach out to get that gaff him and stuff but erratic dark shots yeah the guys did a great job this week everything kind of went the way it should and we have that with three beautiful well we know you've always had a very good working relationship with dot com you guys have been friends for a long long time you got your three fish dave was clearly struggling and so we asked you for a little help here's what happened socks part of the state game we play I hate chasing the bite right now I'm in a last resort situation I have to get some Intel as to where the fish are DJ what happened we got three fish gonna get away there you go now we can't get it together their debut ready i'll give you the numbers we call three fish now away down there still don't get it was officially day maybe only thing good just that anymore voice alright alright babe are ABT Jace tuna gods will help me out that's over out here Tiffany's is a long way but at this point I need efficient one and I need to save fuel you know TJ I know there's a lot of secrecy out there in the water and yet here you were sharing with dot com why I mean in that moment I've got three fish onboard and I want an incredible high you know i mean i-i this there's not much more I could really be happier about so i hear it in his voice he's down he's out and it really it's nothing specifically about that comment could have been Paul have been Tyler I would have done that for anyone i mean i don't know yeah alright likes you know look for it to be reciprocated back my way hey I'm a firm believer in karma and doing the right thing and and that's what i was doing right there it always seems like you're playing the long game and and politic you know a bit about that as well you've been in this fishery for a long time yourself how important is that that networking element the networking element is huge i did not have that last year I had a different boat different crew everything I was battling all across the board but i'm just happy i got it together with these guys networking suit from Tiffany's ledge all the way to Provincetown where we fish all the way to the Catalan main is very big there's a lot of people you need a good network of people to work perhaps and TJ's got I mean they have days where I was fishing up in Maine you know fishing baits it and the next day i'm flying kites of a p-town croissants are you betting right here if you don't get that phone call could be Ted I mean I going at the corner and everyone was calling me because there wasn't any fish around at that we know Tyler even at your age we we've seen you a couple of times this year jump over to a friend's boat even in this episode say hey I'm gonna go off with my buddy here to go catch some bait you seem to know which wich boats in the fleet you can rely on for yeah well I didn't roll too far from this tree over here you know i'm saying i totally understand the importance of a network and I got dropped on my own trying to build my own network of people very important super important you know this is what we do know what we love to do we also saw Dave say hey you know thank you I really appreciate it TJ says right after he gives them the numbers you know I assume that he's gonna reciprocate knowing what you know of Dave what do you think happens next is never going to return the favor okay Whitney when Dave's out fishing it's all about Dave and Dave catchin fish he's been lying to people for years and years and years making everyone think that he's their friend and he's really just trying to gain information like a leech I hear he's coming from and I get it and he does have a reputation of that I just hope that you know i'm not one of those statistics with him he doesn't burn me you'll get burned out on your long way nice line is sometimes burned everyone in the industry doing if he burns me that it's shame on him and all i have to say is what is work for you used to refer to the guys to know don't come and we even pay attention the guy he was a joke well he smoked a slasher your respect well TJ you also said that there's a fisherman's code right you expect that's how I was raised me that you know that what is that come it's just kind of a high-seas courtesy if you're leaving a spot guy needs a bucket of bait or the guy needs anything some food some milk some war bread I mean you know you always should let the helping hand and look for that double anybody any one of us one any kind of trouble Dave would be the Irish what all would have been there we all would be there everyone would be there that's the Mariners code anyone's gonna help anyone if there was its any sort of distress signal made i'm talking about straight up tuna fishing i'm gonna give him the benefit of the doubt until burns but that's alright this week we saw a ton of action but also saw some boats that were waiting around for a bite on the Kellyanne Paul and the guys were there and the guys were keeping busy by cleaning the boat and working out of course let's say this is now the workout area all in the fish and taking naps Kenny and I stayed in shape for me and the big one I'm glad to have you on the boat you know help Fred sure yeah i was gonna love you we don't hook up this could be out back up their hot bodies by Kenny and moral tuna fishing is physically demanding when you look at human I want to look good and I want to stay in shape so yeah I do a little workout i may be sleeping right now but when that line goes off I'm like a ninja of always ready and looking dude my wife's feeling good morrow online to thank you are Paul obviously you missed that because i have never seen anything we didn't see this when he was over now has generally been the corner while these guys turn it into a chancy gym you know you can force a list of my ID at the polls crew in the fleet is cool i guess they gotta look good you know they're not rely on tuna so they got video is hot man I gotta be honest I guess what operations that over all right well maybe you shouldn't be checking lines make sure the balloons are ok yeah charm be like a job being out some

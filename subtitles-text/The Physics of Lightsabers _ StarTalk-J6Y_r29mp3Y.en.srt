startalk we're back featuring my interview with the british physicist Brian Cox so I had to bring up the fact that he and I had like a Twitter argument over the physics of light sabers haha yeah and I just had to bring it up and just open up old wounds yeah right let's find out how it went down I don't remember how this happened i think i tweeted something about wife team and then you jumped in and then people just wanted to fight yeah it was good deep fried I think I said if lightsabers are made of white yeah then they could surely do damage by cutting things but they would not stop one another the way two swords would in a in a swashbuckling encounter that this that's all I said there's a process that I i I've studied actually photon photon are gamma gamma scattering we college ok so we measured process it particle accelerators so very high energies very high energy collisions there is a probability that photons will kick off each of the fans off engine rather than just passed through it so it's remarkable remarkable property of particle physics so they don't interact so I can look at you and all these other ones that are flying because they're don't mess up this view of you but actually radio waves and microwaves your first name yeah yeah I fire all over the place nothing two colliding but actually when you go up high end to high energies then be the probability that photons or climate sugar increases and one of the interesting things to cosmic rays physics that you might know that is that there's a cut off yes we're lucky cut yeah well whether the cosmic rays can be such a high energy that the probability they'll bounce off the photons in the cosmic microwave background becomes high so it so my point was just a technical one that photons do have a there's a probability they'll collide together even if you had this high energy all trying is your lightsaber  it would have to be really really high energy white slavery and so now you know this would come into the regime that you're describing and they would come in contact and they would you would feel this you did that interact with each other wrist like this like these things in training ok what I loved about that though as you said was i love at those and there's an audience for that that kind of interaction that we had in each case really geeky right because you're talking about light I had no the physics of the likes appreciated how much people geek out over there

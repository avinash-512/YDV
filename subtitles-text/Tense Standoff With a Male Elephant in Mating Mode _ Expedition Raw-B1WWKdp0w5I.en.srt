yeah right there right my sister Joy's and myself we're driving to the park hoping that the elephants here won't try to hit us oh look at the size of this we're trying to show these elephants that humans that come in vehicles these days are not here to hurt them the reason to do this is because yours are going to run into this situation too and more time this guy spends around cars the more relax he'll be he's friendly he's not gonna find my keys and lost now we have to be ready to run away ready everybody well he looks pretty down serious I don't like me in a place where i cannot and go to power walk already we have to be extremely careful but at the same time I'm trying to get these amazing shots but when they come they can really just home I know he's leaving in the end he's not interested in that yeah i think it's called he's interested in finding his ladies he's quite sad I don't think I'll ever get used to putting my finger up a water bucks - all right buddy she's when you get a pickle sample you don't mess around just want to be as thorough as possible

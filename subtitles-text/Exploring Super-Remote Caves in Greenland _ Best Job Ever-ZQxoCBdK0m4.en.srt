more people have been to the moon and some of the places that I've been to i'm here to collect samples of plant sites that were deposited in caves over thousands and thousands of years no one has constructed a cave based on it record for green and before and I think that's just because caves containing power side there are so remote three days still walking the rocks are so loose it's like surfing on Marvel's one of the best things about fieldwork is that there's always surprises but right at the back of the case even the ice and this is what we see your most of the caves so far but this one's got quite an interesting because we found remnants of a dead bird the bird is not modern it's definitely old the different layers count sites are like tree rings or different laser nice cause and I can use a different ways to construct a record of climate change for this region I really like the remoteness of case i like the journey that you go on and even when you've been in a cave before you still see new things every time you get ready we got a sample and the best part of my job is that I get to go and see these absolutely amazing places and produce something that is hopefully valuable to all of us in the future you know that maybe we should take some more whole analysis approximately 2,000 below the whales come here every summer to Walter scan socialized raise their young and just below the party

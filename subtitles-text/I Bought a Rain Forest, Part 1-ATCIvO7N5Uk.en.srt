I went on a journey and I went all over the Amazon try and find out the truth about the Amazon this idea of these nasty people destroying amazon they're not just people trying to make a living my source is endless poverty trend three years ago now I've got an illegal coca plantation bomb estate these are all coca leaves they have the highest alkaloid content of any coca leaves in the world which means I'm it really good cocaine and they're mine so I became a coke allured by mistake now I didn't mean to buy a cocaine plantation obviously but I bought over the phone a friend of mine fonia and he said there's this piece of land at the end of a logging road and then at the head of the National Park needs someone to buy it the illegal loggers are going up there but the best track going through the land and into the National Park cover hardwood trees and if someone can buy that piece of land we stand a chance of protecting that part of money national part but what I actually got you know when I got there and sort of several months later was you know hundred acres of severely degraded secondary rainforest and two actors of legal coke i also got an illegal logging camp with an illegal loggers living in it that's silly ass there on the right i bought the land of Tito his dad here on the left and ilyass was one of the most infamous infamous notorious illegal loggers in the area the national parks hated in he was a thief he was a liar he was this he was that and as a result i was actually terrified of him he was so muscley I've never seen a human being i can't get it from that picture but yeah anyways terrified him um  and I would campaign might camped on the land when i first went there not a lie down i could hear the chain stores at night not coming in the morning been massive pile hardwood like in the driveway to my land and then two hours later at gone this kind of went on that went on and then one day so we were filming this is part of a TV documentary and Gavin the director said to me you know you really gotta go meet this guy and i said i'm scared i don't want to and I talked to national parks what is it you've bought the most dangerous piece of land off the most dangerous family in the most dangerous part southern Peru and you know that scared the hell out of me and I'm camping on it and a few years earlier in exactly the same spot where i was campaigning a group of geologists had been basically held up with guns and robbed it was a scary prospect so I didn't want to meet ilyass right Gavin said you're going to have to any force me to do it so we march to the first and I tracked early and it's really hard to find I tracked him through i could find wet footprints and we did this for an hour adventure her to change some and basically I doorstep this man in the middle of cutting a tree down with a whole film crew and it was a really weird moment because you learn how it's good you know really remote far the Amazon this bloke turns out with a boom pole and the kick-out anyway it's not gonna attack us is it every sat down and we hung out and you know nice like basically suspect you got you got to leave you know your is not working you can't stay on this land you aren't you you're the bad illegal or I don't want you understand you're gonna have to leave and he he spun me this line about how he had a disabled daughter and it's all he could do you know to survive and keep her you know keep this family life and you know I didn't believe him going to show you what's that that honor goes to yeah that went on you Cinco which I just thought I'd coming now say hi to your family yeah yeah yeahs cuando se cuando nacido en los tres meses cuando estaba haciendo que la raspa k Sandstrom hasta Mia Rose antonidas in your medicine ball sack o mio job Mako hello moto de mean I ya empieza la ciudad well Elmo todo está bien SE que está muerta bientot ma de quoi cuenta de que haciendo y los tres anos tienes miedo porque nada nomas estaba lloviendo me jose nobile colegio bajar de los ninos de bonnes choses de suspenso inclusive God a.m. interment video was a yummy porque se siente la misma mediados de otro pero solo digo pero lo siento don't want to be alone oh no this made my decision infinitely more complicated as all agree my mind I was going to kill us off the land until I went to his house and what's a busted would I be if I did there's no way behind every terrific story like a bunch of decent people just trying to survive right and I was completely unarmed as a human being to do what I had no idea what i was going to do so I went on a journey to find out the truth about the Amberson trying to find that how can we tackle these problems with it and we can tackle my understanding them so i went on a kind of journey of understanding this is Erasmus he's one of 35,000 gold miners in southern Peru the gold mining is a huge environmental problem you know this is like a modern-day Gold Rush but these guys are chasing dust they're not chasing nuggets and they use a whole load of chemicals within that process mercury particularly if i give you a sense of scale learn there's a truck and . there you see that you start realizing how big is this whole town's of cropped up to supply this trade in town of thousands of people as prostitution as human trafficking it's just Crimea's it's a horrible modern-day Gold Rush so i went to work with Erasmus on his gold mine mrs. one day they got this is six and a half grams of 24-karat gold that's what about a hundred ninety bucks so it takes around 20 tons of toxic waste to make it a gold wedding ring is little clip of love me then that every 16 hours the matter rinse and shaken act before the gold-bearing sludge is scraped into a barrel vegetables this video is it low-key a lawyer as much as Peters giver is a local no porque la quinta they will go to plus they fail those using them included within 15 min tops equal 3 is in Sudan you can come your me of your local sprint a dose annuals in order to the new model series mixing the mercury with with the sludge it wasn't meant to know their you know you had called it for more cool about your care law no order SI se it's our particle Thomas indo- mente and tell a stopper bead I make no other thing morphia if we community seems cool you know nosotros no tenemos a capital like what is so astonishing achievement tournament in the map mercury poisoning can result in brain damage kidney damage lung failure and possibly miscarriage illegal miners dumped nearly 30 tons of this heavy metal in Peruvian rivers every year and a recent study found that many people in local communities at mercury levels in their bodies five times the safe limit somebody in that gold CN so that's the image i took that guy was doing stuff that miraculous feat for an hour when you do that you realize these guys are rich okay the bad guys aren't rich the gold miners are no one's getting rich off this at all it's actually the reverse this guy wanted to go to university had gone to become a gold miner to save up the University he was never going to go to university was poisoning himself to death yet been paid for two weeks the other two workers the work that hadn't been paid for three months you know my saw is this endless poverty cycle is just wrap it was stuck in this poverty trap that they couldn't get out the longer they work to not got paid the more they were committed to work so it's all really just miserable and tragic this was this is where we got our water from and washed every day said mercury tailing the sort of gold mine tailing pond for the mercury so it makes you realize that these guys aren't there now first you know this idea of the Amazon they're not they're

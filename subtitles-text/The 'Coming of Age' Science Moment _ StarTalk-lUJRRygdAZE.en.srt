it wasn't until I was later in in in high school that i had my first biology tutor who sort of gave me the confidence that I could be a scientist I wasn't with her because you're acting correct right I was wrong i was on this show blossom from Northern Water I was lost on and show the lying about and were blah yeah they're clear correct when friends I met this this woman who is my biology tutor that was sort of my my real kind of coming out party of believing didn't even have the skillset because i had i had been paying attention all the previous years in math and science but really just doing what i needed to get by I didn't really understand the beauty of science and math and that whole world until I was later into high school and obviously pursuing it in college was you know it was it was a party so this saddens me you know why not your story attract I've heard that before I know that if the that single person right made a life difference to you right how many people are missing that single person who cannot just I mean I can i am sure we could all run the stats on it many girls right it is the first answer the first name and that's because I mean that's because of historical difference in the representation of women in these fields and and a probably a cultural bias on the part of of teachers and instructors and an even administration how much intellectual capital untapped in this world do I number detector i want i want numbers there's any numbers don't just say I don't have them I think it's a what this is Startalk they'll leave you numberless when we can put numbers in this situation you have the number i have the power I shouldn't have doubted you for a second no I have the power to give you the numbers have the power to get someone to give you them that's how I work for Howard to listen to those number so Mona can I get some numbers please everyone's motor lobby she's a data journalist didn't even know that thing existed money you got some numbers for us to bring some of us into focus and do I wanted to try on some items question as directly as possible so i wanted to find out how many female scientists America is missing and the number i came to its 80,000 missing meaning they might have been scientist but some force prevented that from happening exactly exactly good and i just took biologists chemists and a category called other natural scientists and i worked at how many women you would need to just get to a 50-50 gender split and that's when I got 80,000 so when you say 80,000 it's just 80,000 those professions exactly what you're leaving out engineering and physics and mathematics mathematics and all the rest of this yeah okay but presumably i equal access equal opportunity doesn't require equal outcome so that that missing number presumes that if everything were even then everything would be even right but we know that we don't have equal access right now I am touched on in the clip and its really really relevant so I also looked at some of the cultural barriers that stopped him from going into the sciences now we know that statistically women are less likely to be hired by science faculty they're less likely to be asked to perform mathematical tasks and they're less likely to have their academic papers deemed of high quality and I know that last bit because of research by a female scientists called mr pearson now what image was she looked at 930 8301 academic scientific papers and she found that the average male scientists publishes 45% more papers than the average female scientist so you're saying we were messed up that's what you're saying that's how to be messed up numerical in numbers numbers are showing how messed up you are

we get to know the real talk and we're on you just watch the all-new episode of wicked tuna and now it's time for wicked tuna realtalk web show were Gloucester's top bluefin tuna captain's will give us their take on what just happened i'm mike sulk i am your host and joining us this week we've got three captains with us first captain Dave Marciano the hard merchandise captain Paul Ebert of the kelly and captain Dave Carraro of fishing vessel tuna.com guys thank you for being with us today on this last episode we saw the fleet's underdog boats fighting hard to stay in the race with a new boat drama joining the competition will get to that may enough to a bit of a rocky start over on.com we saw first made Sandro take over the reins when Davis away so there was a lot going on in this episode we have a ton to talk about i want to start with being an underdog we've seen Dave kind of race off to the lead pinwheels kind of been right there with them but there's an underdog mentality and Dave I know the hard merchandise always sort of has that feel and I know your fans feel that way to that you're sort of that lovable underdog that you can root for would you be happier being the favorite yeah i don't know i mean you know that but it'd be nice to have it all be easy right but maybe again life ain't like that right life is real you don't always get what you want sometimes you just got to get by with you know you get what you need right there you have bottom line is you just gotta keep driving that's the only thing I know how to do their level of pride that comes with Adam and you've got this boat sank a couple years ago you have to rebuild it seemed to sort of struggled along your way how much pride is that does that tell ya there's a certain amount of make sure i wish i could say i had the biggest baddest fanciest boat in the fleet pride that goes with that and great for the guys who do that like gave you know he's got a gorgeous boat at least you know for me that gives me a goal in life right hey maybe someday if I workout enough maybe i will get that boat they'll be faster than the okay great they don't want to do a friends of mine know it at least you know the meaning in the meat i know sometimes you gotta take what you got and make it work roles and graded well pause basically been your life i'm even a lot of boats we've talked about that the underdog mentality has to be important to have been an underdog my whole life I was always a couple years behind all my brothers fishing they all had boats I couldn't afford about it was a little kid so coming into this it has given me a big step forward to go for something it has given me a big big time thing to foresee i can get my own boat I can achieve goals that I never thought I could it's been a big deal for me you're more immediate goal is just to kind of ratchet up the fish counter right hands are falling behind on all of our game is to put meat on the deck how quickly change right now you write down near the bottom how we lookin chain in one day one day everything can turn change in an hour in yeah exactly Dave last year you were just far away beyond everybody else in this year your little bit more of a of a dogfight for how motivating is that it's a very motivating you know I mean last year you know we came out strong and we finish strong it was a slow your fishing we were just able to capitalize the most of the Vice we lost very few fish and as you saw we caught quite a few but you know I know these guys are going to come out knowing what i just said and they're gonna come out running and gunning for me so we don't we better be ready we got to get to my favorite mall this is my favorite moment that we've had so far on wicked tuna and I can't wait to talk about it i hope you feel a little guilty this is what I'm excited because now you've seen it is senior epic rant well i would say you've heard it because you know there's children out there and all that and there's delicate ears how does you lost two in a row the second one was basically right there at the boat when it got away you're just about to take the shot that thing takes off what what what broke you don't know yeah the line well it you know that what the swivel gym in the tip but whatever it was it was like it just goes is part I i usually try to stay positive losing a few is by the game right but now the reality of life kisses up you need a paycheck things go wrong hey everybody has their breaking point I'm not proud of that right it's not like you know I wanted to show my son hey this is a great way to behave right there's a lot of stress a lot of money on their loss that's bad stuff around but you know what everybody has a breaking point and apparently that they reach by did you get the the shot of the two of them kind of scuttling away far away in the world yeah yeah I didn't say that hey any word from a book about 40 feet longer right no but he's gone posted but then enjoy watching a really big fish at the end of this so I mean we're now it is just the sort of up the embarrassment I was like oh my god I can't believe I thought that way just a few minutes ago I felt you know if you are right within JJ has this thing if you ask my bill tell you sometimes that's exactly what it takes for us to get things going you I need to have a complete meltdown it's that's that crowd and all of a sudden fits that coming we're going to use the word tantrum if you're willing to call yourself a tantrum that I think that's the right word for it we had Dru how to deal with losing fish I mean it happens all the time but i do i've been doing this for a long time I've watched my father rant and rave over twenty-five cents a pound it's just the feeling of struggling catching a fish you sitting you're fighting fish week at the week and you're losing them you're losing them your snap it's just the overcoming catching one I mean it's all the bottom line is the money for us now there's a lot of money on the line and it costs a lot of money to go fishin it's just like I've see Dave workout before years ago when i first went I remember when we lost that one I startled and I would happen we had a doubleheader just feel like through it's gonna be alright we're gonna get my button and days like like six losses and we lost like 11 in a row right more than what does not come look like when he freaks out and I guess we saw a free hour earlier here is great because he felt great after that he was like you got it we caught him good was something i can write and we saw you get mad at Tyler this year that's the most we've seen you lose your cool at any point like the show would you say that and then after that you started catching fish again and it cannot explosive release of energy be helpful for you out there maybe not you know whether that's why we're catching fish or not I don't know but you know like they've said everybody has a breaking point you know maybe that's what it takes to reach a breaking point you're maxed out now you realize you've done bad let's stay focused lets you know pay attention to the task and and that's catching fish in making money well Davis freaking out Paul you just seem to be catching fish are in a groove at this point we've got three in three weeks said was just sort of a little fish in this case it wasn't a huge 100 nice it was a big money fish don't you know sometimes big fish little fish big payoff right yeah you know you had 800 pounds that paid two bucks a pop you feel like right now this is sort of you get your groove on a new beau new crew youse guys sort of started playing yourself everything with the guys on the boat because we're just starting to learn their opening up now they weren't you know they were very conservative at the beginning just waiting for me trying to learn of what i'm going to do instead of just jumping in and saying what about this what about you know it's hard to get like Dave's had signed up for a long time he's a DJ for a long time you just use it you get it it's a team you need a team to catch these fish and you gotta learn to give you don't worry what each other want or do and learn their likes and dislikes and go with that are you sure they're being conservative or maybe they just wasn't enough room for them to talk i mean that's always a possibility this there's a lot of Paul on that before when I said I work a lot what time my hands down I think it's not need my hands well you mentioned the communication and when you watch the dot-com that seems to be what jumps out to me is how easily you and Sandra community coming okay i want to get back together so long well you guys almost our drama free out there maybe it just feels like you're there's almost a mind-meld between your you barely need to say anything in order to do the right thing and there's there's a reason for that you know like so whenever I bring somebody new on the boat I like to hire training without any experience just like he said yeah I like that person to go from from kindergarten all the way through the grades with me on the teacher the whole time this way it's not like taking someone on like Paul and no offense but no things differently different way yeah he wanted his way I wanted my way right overall you know on the cap and I have the final say values it doesn't happen although I respect his opinion with Sondra now we don't have to talk because I know what he's thinking and he knows what I'm thinking because that's the way I brought him up through the years I've been fishing with me when you hold him the way Dave wants him to be and he taught and like you with Jay yeah you mold them so we know what the what each other do at certain times we know what to do when to do how to do it how to make dave not better person how what to do when he freaks out what to do when he's happy you know I mean doesn't make everything easy it's a year but not everybody you bring on your boat can excel like Jay did so I had a lot of meats come work a few years think they've got it all have all the pieces of the puzzle and they move on never catch up they talked to talk but you're interesting in the rockwell let's talk about the guy who is on your boat right now Cassandra had a great week right goes out there takes a new guy will talk more about Georgie here in just a moment but he goes out there by himself without you were first where were you just hanging out how is that work days at work so he has hey guys take the boat go do a little fishing and he comes back with a gigantic all brown is a proud moment for you first of all for me to let somebody take my boat means i have a lot of trust and that person so that says a lot right there whether they catch a fish or they know a lot of bad things happen out there so i gotta trust those guys taking my boat without sinking and coming back alive that alone is is a is that she has such as you make that offered he come to you with the ib the offer you know Saunders been with me he's never really fish much before he's never been on a boat before he's never seen into before but he just learned so fast and I said this kid has what it takes he gets it in peelings and for me to let those two young boys go out take the boat to the fishing grounds wherever they chose to go to accomplish the task and that's catching fish not only did they catch a fish they caught a big fish at that and he was like just over 700 pounds dressed and that was being there and not only is amazing that's just a great feeling for me I have no kids but those no Sandow is my kid so to speak and just to watch you know something someone that you've taught to you know if there's a like that and do that and say see the kid he's got it who would you let your would you let JJ I'll take the boat out without you you know i don't think they quite ready for that in a lot of it has to do with its the boat to the thing about my boat it's because it's not newest in everything's not perfect right it has a lot of little things that like you know I'm ready for stuff to go wrong at any second you guys know you've seen it over the years oh my god ok oh yeah that's a lot of levels of electricity Jake the cat had merchandise ground how many of those problems are self created from you tearing stuff off the window so drop it and it will bring some of them were just with david and i bought himself a lot to pee if if it James force it if it breaks you need to replace it anyway right no well Dave you also decided in this after that moment with sandra going out with Jordan that you're gonna take on a third member of your crew what y Jory what it what impressed you what made you make that decision mean I I talk to sondra about it and he said he did real well out there you know jordans just a he's a young kid and he's just appeared to be very motivated and I take Saunders word for many things and he said he likes he likes jordan and he wants to bring them on you guys have talked about him before remember last you went on throughout the year hearing you guys talk about how much Sandro added to daves bowknot that you're taking credit away from Dave but just how much of it you guys seem to be very melding together to have a crew member you guys are both vouch for this to have someone that you can like take a day off and they can go out and catch fish they bring a lot to the plate it's not easy you feel if this fishery was easy everyone would do it for a living not everyone does it for a living it's very struggling I mean we have David I have a really hard time but you know he's got it going on he has got the team that is it's a golden team was probably all that the perfect segue into what we saw with the guys from the drama who want to try to make it in this fishery they want to try to be a part of the fleet landing right what do you make of their opening salvo into that because it didn't it didn't start on girly for that no I didn't you know what that I think to exert an extent I think we all went through it right with us every night that time not any one of us here was you know born with the knowledge by all of this racket at least for myself was going out there putting my time in making mistakes and learn from them and moving forward right all along from was just a year ago we saw Paul drivers boat up onto the ground so I mean if this is your Fargo man discovered Plymouth Rock gonna tail but I like what you said Paul the first thing you said to them was that you were impressed with the hard work how far can that go in making it in this business that is everything I always said if I could get a deckhand for somebody to work with me not for me someone like myself with like the drive that Sandro has you need someone like you i mean that's that's the way to do it you know just take someone off the street that's very little experience fishing again every July are teaching miss they're absorbing there's no the other way just your way what they say that was just you know what's the best advice you would give to their guys on the drama wow I don't I mean don't give up start over and do over yeah it's tough on that small boat I know I fish small boats my old life yeah and they're just learning like they look when i first came to gloss that I had to get familiar i didn't know Dave that well italy and just jump in or you're going to pay you do we've all paid dues like the cases hundreds of thousands of guys are gonna do better than others sooner you know just for someone to get a boat and think it's easy to go out and catch a bluefin tuna going to be in for a rude awakening it's not as easy as just going out anchored up shaman put bait on a hook watching the balloon go down real hard is easy as seen on tv years and you said what are we doing this for still well I know what I'm gonna hook up I learned this week that if i want to go out catching bluefin tuna I gotta keep my anchor off of other people's boats going to start screaming for the thing and get the bleep button and the fish just jump onto the bugs I learned something thank you for teaching me all right guys good stuff as always all the time we have for this installment of Real Talk a hearty thank you to captain Dave Marciano I don't think that bleep during this

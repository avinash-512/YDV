what's in here what's it do and can i make it from scratch it's the stuff inside your stuff ingredients first things first these are not shaving cream or actually shaving foam shaving cream is more like face cream and that deserves its own episode as does shave gel and shave soap but today is all about this guy and the truth is many of you could probably shave your face with just water you would though have to soak your beard here for a good two minutes to crack trial on it takes for her to get hydrated and soft about thirty percent softer than normal but all of these make the shaving experience nicer and easier shaving products lubricate the interface between skin and the sharp blade and some people say they help keep beard hairs wet during the shape so why use one of these over another honestly it's just personal preference the cream and the gels tend to be a bit thicker so if you have a thick beard that might be for you where's the phones and the soaps tend to wash off a little bit easier foam in particular is convenient when it comes out of the can re lathered up so you just stick it on your web face and you're off shaving now the two best-selling shave balms in the US have basically the same ingredients they are this one has BHT which is preservative this one does not they both have fragrances and it's actually kind of amazing how different the fragrances are this one is somewhat like a like a locker room with wood cleaner and this one sort of hours ago like a citrus citrus leather type smell shockingly different anyway aside from water the essential ingredients can be split up into five types the first is a lubricating soap in this case triethylamine stearate now ta stearate which you can think of as stearic acids are chemical cousin is responsible for making all that ladder which reduces friction between the razor blades and the second category are the foam boosters or laura 23 and sodium lauryl sulfate which helped make all that leather extra creamy the third category is the fragrance and the fourth is the preservative in this case BHT an antioxidant that helps prevent the can from crewing at the last group of ingredients are the propellants specifically I some butane and propane which are both flammable and explosive so whatever you do do not just kidding at reasonable temperature and pressure this will not combust because there's not nearly enough isobutane and propane to make this whole thing Flamel in fact I could take a lighter to it and as you can see it does not come bust but you should still not try this at home because this can is under pressure now you might be wondering why there are propellants in shaving foam well it's what makes the foam foam now phones in general are formed when pockets of gas get trapped in a solid or a liquid inside our can here we have the first four ingredients i showed you there are also the propellants which are gases at room temperature and pressure so you expect that they sit above the liquid since they're less dense but the whole can is pressurized at 224 times atmospheric pressure which ends up liquefying some of the propellant meaning it actually dissolves in the soapy mixture below when you press this button the propellant gas at the top expands pushing the liquid down which in turn pushes it up through the straw out the nozzle and into the world now here is the absolutely insane part remember that the soapy mixture coming out of the nozzle that has some liquid propellant dissolved in it and when that liquid propellant hits our atmosphere it turns back into a gas which gets trapped in the surrounding liquid creating bubbles billions of them now those bubbles are way smaller than anything you get if you just lather up with soap or use one of these air pump and foamy things and it's the tiniest of the bubbles that gives shaving foam structure now that we know what's in shaving foam and how it works I'm gonna try and make my own from scratch using only natural ingredients i'm gonna start with the exact same ingredient you find in commercial shave foam and stearic acid which I'm going to react with sodium hydroxide and that will get us stearate which hopefully will produce a rich creamy lubricating lather both of these by the way you can get from nature and sodium hydroxide can be a bit dangerous which is why I'm wearing safety gear also use this natural soap as a phone booster because it foams up real nice for fragrance rosemary essential oil and because i don't want to be dealing with pure concentrated flammable gases i'm going to use nitrous oxide as my propellant and i'm going to use this whipping cream canister to dispense my phone so let's get started yeah this is getting slimy which is a good sign for a lubricating soap some tight now we charge it to shake all right moment of truth hey that's not bad it did foam up i can see the bubbles and it's not quite as structured as the commercial phones i would guess that my stearate concentration is probably too low for that but let's now see how this actually performs on the face I didn't soak my beard hair so this is probably going to hurt but for science yeah by the way this smells this is really not bad at all this shaving foam is performing a smooth had a very well i i'm i'm impressed i would give this an 8 out of 10 now if you guys have ideas on how to improve this recipe let me know in the comments if you have an idea for an episode hit me up on Twitter and in the meantime I'm gonna finish

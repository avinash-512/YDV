when planets are destroyed they form an asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter there's an asteroid belt was there a secret planet there hey there star children trace here for dnews thanks for tuning in a few weeks back we talked about how the death star could block the planet of Alderaan resulting in the formation of an asteroid belt and that got me thinking we have an asteroid belt and I wasn't the only one on twitter you are shawn pitts asked do you think our asteroid belt was a planet once and if it was how big was it the asteroid belt which strangely doesn't have a name is just called the asteroid belt or main asteroid belt sits between two and four astronomical units from the Sun past Mars before it's comprised of millions of space rocks ranging in size from small particles to the largest known asteroids series which is 600 miles in diameter so was there a planet there but we know the birth of our solar system know there never was but almost gravity is the support structure formation of celestial bodies it pulls material together so it can form stars moons planets galaxies so on too little or too much and they won't form and that area between Mars and Jupiter is the ladder too much gravitational interference caused it to become a bunch of there's a pretty little planet physics dictates how far away those bodies have to be from each other to maintain stable orbits this was discovered in the late 18th century by je boat and is called the tightest bowed law essentially each planet's orbital period is equal to the period of the sun's rotation and distance of the farthest reaches of their orbit according to this mathematical equation there should be a planet in between Mars and Jupiter the orbit fits with the math and a planet trying to form but Jupiters massive gravity tortoise under it just couldn't do it we know all that now but from the 18th and into the 19th century people believe that they simply haven't spotted the elusive planet yet and then in 1801 giuseppe piazzi discovered series he believed that series might be a comment but it didn't have a coma the gas and dust that surrounds a comment a bit over a year later a german named Heinrich overs discovered another small object on the same orbit that he called to policy eventually as more of these were discovered astronomers knew there was no planet in this orbit but instead what they called asteroids they discovered despite what conspiracy theorist may say on the internet these billions of little asteroids never formed into a planet instead the gravitational forces of our solar system kept it as a bit of rock and dust but since shawn pitts wanted to know how large a planet would be if it did happen to form we could give it a guess today series comprises one third of the mass of the whole if you were to glomp the mass of the rest of the belt on to you'd still have less mass than our Moon dr. Ian o Neill space producer for Discovery News says our moon would still be 26 times more massive than this superseries like super tiny asteroids do occasionally fly by earth which some would call a close shave but if you want a real close try Harry's we'd like to thank them for sponsoring this episode i use Harry's twice a week shaved my neck not so much the beard part but the neck definitely in the blades are sharp and the after shave it smells great a starter kit includes 3 razors a handle in your choice of shave cream or foaming shave gel I go to jail it smells really good I'm not kidding go to Harry's . com now get your starter kit for only 15 bucks and with our code dnews can get five dollars off of that and then you can smell for yourself all this comes back to planets and their gravity and also the order of those planets are in Jupiters massive gravity can really stop the yard astronomically speaking but how did the planets get in that Amy and I tackle that one in this video the question about planetary formation remains an ongoing debate because we've never seen a planet form our solar system is just one of many possible configurations and formations but how we got here is pretty cool stuff thanks so much for your question Sean and thank you all for watching dnews what are the awesome science questions you guys have you can tweet at us using the hashtag ask dnews you can let us know down in the comments and we'll figure it out thanks for watching yeah

yeah when I'm traveling through the forest in a river swamp I like to keep a good idea where I'm at it's really old pine stump that's full of pine resin I stripped a little bark off of it about 20 years ago as a landmark for me a very valuable resource I don't use a map I don't use a compass they make a thing called a GPS Global Positioning System I think for the college my god i like to pin on natural resources brain common sense if the brain in common sense ever quits working in trouble but even if I do get lost i'm home i just have to camp in a different place in the feral swamps of Georgia frontiersman Colbert dirt is in the final throes of trapping season a lot of indication of early spring early leaves and flowers and buds just got a short time left to harvest first in the winter trapping season the advantage of having traps overhunting is I can be in a dozen places at one time so it makes me more efficient more effective this is a good place for me to set a trap his trapping is important to me this year even more than ever because the money that I gained from the pelts that together I used to buy new supplies and rebuild my cabin I want to put the trap as close to the roots to make this the obvious travel way and then he'll see the state can automatically dive underwater to go through it that looks like a pretty good set just about any animal that comes by get caught in that trap and i'll have fur and that's what I'm after they gotta work my job as a trapper paying attention knowing animal habits and behaviors and habitat and adapt accordingly ok I think I like it about right there you never know for sure what's going through an animal's mind but I'd like to take a little water it looks like an order came up through here recently i'm going to go ahead and set the trigger ok that traps active ready to catch the next animal that comes

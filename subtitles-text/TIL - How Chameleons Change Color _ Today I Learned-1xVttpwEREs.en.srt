scientists thought that chameleons change color by changing the pigment in their skin not sure how they actually change color is far more complex basically they have these nano salt crystals within their skin cells and those crystals refract light yeah so how a chameleon actually changes color is by tuning or actually physically changing how close those salt crystals are to each other those crystals refract a different wavelength which makes them appear as though they're changing from green to blue to red to one that's cool without larger scavengers to help them out vultures have to go for the softest part of the carcass first life the eyeballs and the button

now we're playing a game called time factors I fiction and you're going to identify whether you think it is a five thousand or a sci-fi action or maybe you don't know if I don't know either I won't claim to know that sounds good the days are shorter millions of years in the past course they're shorter yesterday than they are today the moon is tugging on earth rotation slowing us down and it will do so eternally until Earth Day equals the lunar month at which point earth and the moon will be in title race next humans get a little taller in space because there's no gravity to wait and down we actually get a lot taller in space by several inches and it's not so much you weigh down the the discs between your bones and they just kind of Lucena and in fact astronauts need different space suits fitted for them when they go spacewalking then when they watch you need space suits that are taller 4 when they've stretched out the Great Wall of China is the only man made object you can see from space first of all I you cannot see the Great Wall China from space unless you have liked but are killers or a telescope or something it's no wider than our interstate highways in America but no one talks about how I see I 10 going across the United States which would be practically as long as the Great Wall China would be but no one says they see that it is a science fiction that you could see it all anything with their eyes open as possible I bet you can pry your eyelids open and then sneeze I don't know if your eyes will pop out at you can pry your eyelids open but I think it is a fact that nobody sees as ever with their eyes open they have to close their eyes lightning never strikes the same place right false with lightning rod for you strike the same place so that it doesn't have to strike a place you don't know about Empire State Building struck hundreds of times a year plus they're they're people who've been hit by lightning more than once you tell them leading to strike the same place where the eff them about have been answered that question and we're all done I think you got all the right that was pretty good yeah when I it's what you do thank you for playing style section

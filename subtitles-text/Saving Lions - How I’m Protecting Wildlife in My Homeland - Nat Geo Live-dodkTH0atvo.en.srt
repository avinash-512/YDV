a beautiful witness is in trouble it's being Hamid on all sides by human encroachment poaching and habitat degradation and our mission is to save these like cats dogs and all these other species in our beautiful ecosystem that means long valley is indeed one of Africa's best kept secrets this environment is so awesome that it is one of the last remaining strongholds for lions on the African continent I have been very fortunate to live in this beautiful environment surrounded by wild life and living here I've been able to see animals live in action previously i only used to see them on a tiny black and white TV but I was fascinated even then my uncle wax is a safari guide and he always came home with wonderful stories of animals that he made during his work and those just fascinated me they encouraged me to join my secondary school conservation club so I could learn more about these species I found many fascinating things about the animals in this place but also really sad news our ecosystem was under threat from you know common things that are affecting many other places in the world human encroachment poaching habitat destruction you name them and so I decided then meant to say i'm going to do something about it I decided to become a wildlife that so I could help treat and cure animals that had survived bullet wounds from porches and so I started really hard I would stand at night really late at night with my feet in a bucket of cold water so i could make the grades to get into University and that didn't work I was very lucky I got admitted into the private program it you bc in Canada ready to go take on this challenge to become a wildlife it but you know it didn't go down well as second year into the program i discovered i could not handle cutting anything with a sharp knife and so my dream for vet school crashed and burned right there he was so sad that spent so many sleepless nights studying to do this but it did not end there I got diverted into a different carrier part where I could still help these animals I currently work as a wildlife biologist with the Zambian kind of a program and our mission is to save these large cuts wild dogs my absolute favorite and beautiful ecosystem through applied research and community-based conservation so my job is one of the best on the planet I get to see and touch animals that had only seen in books and magazines before and it's an amazing experience I get to collect key data on survival on who's going where who's eating what and what sort of areas they're using in our beautiful ecosystem a typical day begins with me and my partner in crime are Gibson bandits not crime crime because Gibson is a Wildlife police officer with the Department of Wildlife the national parks in Zambia and he is a great person to work with he's a comedian so we're laughing all the time he's a wonderful human gps he knows the system like the back of his hand and this is an area the size of Yellowstone National pack so it's great we get carried away sometimes we out for days we ran out of what time we had to share water holes and drinking . with people's elephant and sometimes we get to some really bad places you know we get stuck and you getting back on the road can take anything between 15 minutes 24 hours sometimes the best we can hope for is an entire afternoon but it works out why able to get around and so this difficult task if you call it is compensated by even more beautiful pictures like this one our absolute favorite to see out in the field is a male strawberry blonde lion code ginger he is not in Virginia his monster very blonde but strawberry is not a good name for a pepper mill life so ginger has a brother code garlic and garlic is irregular we always happy to see Gallic he's a lion what's not good about that anyway all of these wonderful seen all of these amazing experiences in the field lead to the sad reality that we have to live with animals are being affected by the poaching crisis fueled by the illegal bushmeat trade these are not the targeted species for the bushmeat trade we do not eat lions we don't eat wild dogs but people are going for deer size until hope that they can sell to urban areas and all those places the methods that they use a non-selective so that means animals anything that is obvious shoulder height this short height can get in and get caught and the impacts are catastrophic as you can see animals die and animals lose their legs and that is just pretty sad but we work really hard to save as many animals as we can and working really closely with people that are in the park all the time helps us do what we do and these i'm happy to say made a complete recovery animals do recover even from injuries that as gruesome is that just going to share one story about a particularly favorite line of mine who we call funny ear very and it's a very an imaginative name for a really beautiful likeness but funny there was a young line is when i first started with a Zambian carnival program she was about a year and a half she stands out because of high ear that funny ear in 2010 she picked up a snare in her travels with her president it was pretty sad but likely the people that supported her and they reported to us and we're able to go there check off this Nair and she healed remarkably well and so has story kinda ends in a beautiful Disney stipe you know that this dial ending she got her brain's and well couple princess because he's a lioness in a prime really beautiful and in 2015 we saw funny areas have first liter of Cubs really amazing a graduation ceremony of some sorts so gives us hope to keep on pushing and keep on working and so we've had all about getting people to care and every society every culture has a saying that goes in the line children are the future and we take that too hard to not wake and we really tried to work really hard with these communities and these students to just get them become environmentally conscious lawyers teachers nurses and conservation leaders of the next generation with that students out in the field and not expose them to add life in their natural habitat and it's just an amazing experience and these kids love being out in the field they don't want the field work to stop so it gives us hope two see that they're ready to learn and they're willing to go the extra mile and along with this condemnation education work we want to impart skills that will empower them going forward so it skills like public speaking writing computers that can be taken for granted in the developed world and in our cities their students who have the chance to get and sort of equal footing almost with regards to uni admission getting employment anything other than poaching and so last year with a generous support from the big cat initiative wherever to do a human wildlife conflict study focused entirely on understanding people's interactions to be cut and also other carnivals it was a nice opportunity for students to get in the villages talk to people share their conservation message but also we found have believed that there is not as much conflict as we thought in our part of the world but there was a lot of negative perceptions about be cuts in general we need to get people to care about these issues and it comes from us all of us that I here talking to them about experiences that we've had with these animal  is a lease deal middle school right here in DC and they did a podcast on what it means to them to conserve lions and I'm going to quote one of what one of the students said she said we need to give be cuts and large predators a chance we are their only predator they cannot survive without our help thank you

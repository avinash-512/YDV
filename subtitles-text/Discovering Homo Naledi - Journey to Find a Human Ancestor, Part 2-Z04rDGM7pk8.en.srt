Rick and Steve had no idea what type of bones they were looking but they seemed intriguing they took pictures and decided to show them to Pedro so needless to say i called professor burger he didn't answer his phone we decided we're going to drive to his house because now we're all excited bubbling of course arriving at his home around the belt and really answered my question was Leigh you really want to talk to us I know immediately that that was a fossil hamid and it was not a human I could tell by the proportions of the teeth I could tell by its size you can see that fine scientific scale that I'm lucky we have not got in trouble for because if you read carefully says home sewing aid only on the side of it but I could see that this was something extraordinary second to that it was just lying there on the ground now that doesn't happen in south africa i assure you it doesn't happen in south africa that skull that you saw that Matthew had found in that hard rock that rock is like concrete that skull and skeleton just one of them took about 22,000 preparation hours to get to that state this is lying there the next picture confirm that this was something truly extraordinary every one of those bones I realized with Hamid believe me they are any one train for me would look at that and say my gosh and they're just lying there in dirt even more extraordinary there was a skull can you see the curvature they're just sitting in dirt on the floor and it looked tiny so i decided i need to put someone in there that i absolutely trusted that could take a scientific photograph of these things and i happen to know someone who fit the physiological profile that could get down that cave I trusted immensely my then six foot four son who's sitting in the audience today who is physiologically appropriate get down a seven and a half inch slot showed him how to use a scientific camera gave him a and a few days later we went into this cave a torturous route that took us almost 50 minutes to get to the base of dragons back up we went up this thing where if you slip off you die we get to the edge of that curve loss and we look down it and down i sent Matthew with Rick and Steve because i'm trying for father of the year there i sat in the dark looking at this impossible route how in the world was i going to accomplish an expedition in excavation here 45 minutes or so go by and I hear scrabbling Matthews head pops up because I'm going for father year I didn't know you are you okay i went and and Matthew handed me the camera and said daddy it's amazing - beautiful it was everything that those original pictures it said and that's when I know I had to push the button didn't know what button to push because i needed people to work in there I need people to effectively risk their lives in a well known cave down a seven and a half inch slot underground in a fragile relatively shallow environment that could have gases in it could collapse at any time I had no idea how is going to find people with skills and to be paleoanthropologists archaeologists and to be able to excavate there they have climbing skills all these things I did what any one of you would do i put a facebook at out that facebook ad asked for skinny scientists they had to be able to work in underground environments climbing skills not claustrophobic that wasn't telling them what they do that to drop everything be ready within three weeks from that date to come for a month south africa i wasn't going to pay you oh and by the way you have to have a PhD or masters in pale anthropology archaeology eccentric cetera hit Send thinking the replied 3 people in the world that would fit that within 10 days i had almost 60 qualified applicants eighty percent of which were young women i selected from that six extraordinary scientists who just happened to be young women these extraordinary scientists dropped everything and flew to South Africa within three weeks we'd put together a 60-person expedition all the support teams you need the safety cavers planning this extensive underground expedition at the same time this great society took another risk they agreed to do this live to the world because i thought this may be the last moment in history where we actually can bring the world the recovery of a fossil Hamid skeleton and so they let us create this blog and website already to tweet and facebook and blog and go live on the day we went underground a very brave move by the way because if I was wrong this was going to be a rather large embarrassment on November the seventh that 60 team expedition launched in the field over the next couple of days we laid three and a half kilometers of military-grade audio-visual cables cameras all the machinery that we would need to conduct this excavation live underground we would create command centers caving tins aside I instant to take this skeleton out live in front of the world in November tenth we launched the rising star expedition there we sent those scientists into this cave lad initially by matthew and we watch these amazing images very quickly these amazing scientists became known as underground astronauts and yes i have received enough hate mail about why they shouldn't be called astronauts they should be called Terra not sort rugland knots or some other version of that I am I apologize but I'm not that sorry because it really was like watching astronauts on the space walk it kid up in the safety year helmets on all this stuff and equipment and they would vanish from our sites and they would appear in these black-and-white images as they crawled through these cave systems taking off in 40 45 minutes to get to that shoot and then they would vanish from our communications as they went down the slot where they could wear no safety gear because it's a tight and they began to excavate material and these are the kind of images that we were watching I could communicate live with them they couldn't see me but I could talk to them the collection began we designed technology that had never been used before underground white light laser scanners that were giving us real time scans on computers like that down to resolution 2.3 of a millimeter is we're mapping underground with these scanners it was amazing and material began to come out and buy the second day we realized i had been wrong it was not a skeleton it was more than one skeleton by day two we had three right femur assure you there's no primate in the world has three right legs as we would go by the end of the first week we had discovered more fossil Hamid material then in the richest site ever discovered in the search for human origins in southern Africa in one week and I could see that site right out my command center because it was less than a mile away

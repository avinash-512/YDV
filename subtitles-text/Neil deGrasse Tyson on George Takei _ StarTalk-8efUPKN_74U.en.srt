the original Star Trek characters are such iconic figures in our culture that I can't have start talk series unless there's a star trek person in there somewhere and the opportunity to interview George Takei was special for me because I i saw Star Trek in his first run way back in the 1960s and to see the Starship Enterprise the how integrated it was for its day oh my gosh and there's George Takei I was jealous of his martial arts abilities and his fencing abilities but to realize that there's a whole life that he has led since he's been on Star Trek that makes them in an important American citizen and important observer American culture a person whose life has been touched by the dreams and visions of a space enthusiasts Gene Roddenberry and who has touch other people in the spirit of the way he was touched by Gene Roddenberry back in the 1960s so to get him on on Startalk I I delighted that opportunity

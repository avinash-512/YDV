I'm gonna go get in my poop dumping uniform see any minute working with poop and Haiti may not necessarily seem like something you could really put your heart into like a job you could really love okay ready yes but basically we've created this way to do this work with dignity and to make a livelihood that you can feel proud of we convert human waste into fertile soil that can be used in agriculture instead of being dependent on foreign countries to send fertilizer to restore haiti soil ecological sanitation is a way that haiti can use the resources that we have here to actually generate something locally more than half of the people living in Haiti do not have a private place to go to the bathroom the impacts of people not having access to a toilet are twofold it's really it's about public health and it's also about we really rely on the power of ecological systems once we dump the waste most of the work is then by naturally occurring soil microbes the decomposition is ongoing and after about six months we have a finished product which is just this beautiful rich if tp- so you tell you that the post to post ideas that's the middle nothing not even selected people can actually feel like they're part of a movement to restore haiti soil to restore Hades environment i have such an amazing team of dedicated passionate brilliant people around me every day it's a job that not only can you make a livelihood doing it but you can feel very proud to be a part of restoration when you work in an environment like that you can be knee-deep in poop and it's still the best job ever mmm being a young girl loving dinosaurs that little bit unusual and everyone thought I was kind of weird but you said get over that

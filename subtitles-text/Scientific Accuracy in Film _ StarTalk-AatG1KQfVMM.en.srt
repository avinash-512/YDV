I've gotten a lot of complaints from people saying get over it it's just a movie anytime I list things that a movie might have gone wrong but I think they just don't understand me well I'm not there to just be killed I'll you watching a movie a movie that invests heavily in getting things right he kinda interesting to see what they might have gotten wrong or what they would have overlooked I don't think you should deny me that access to the movie you wouldn't do that if you happen to be friends with her a world-class costume designer and their they come see movies you know that hoop skirt was invented ten years later than the scene that they're portraying their so they miss you be intrigued by that maybe their costume designer got it wrong that's kind of interesting I think it gets a little closer to the Phil with to the making the film and and and the creativity of the people engaged if a movie has no pretense are getting anything right up what happens to get a few things right a call that up I think it gives you more things to pay attention to I don't I'm not apologetic about that I up if it enhances your moving fine if you could ruins it for you I there are then break don't invite me to the movies with you

look at that guy he thinks these players how do you fight a man invited women and everyone in between trace here with some brain nutrition for you for dnews vitamin D is everywhere in our diets these days sort of you can get it in cereal milk orange juices and other fortified foods as well as in fatty fish egg yolks and a few other places but mostly vitamin D comes from you from your skin you make it vitamin D is actually a group of five fat soluble molecules and it's the main animal version d3 that promotes the absorption of calcium for our bones without vitamin D adults can experience osteomalacia pain and weakness and children can develop Ricketts a softening of the bones growth plates which can lead to bowed legs bottom line d 3 it's real important but let's get back to this skin thing plants have photosynthesis right well we have dermal vitamin synthesis deep in the skin is a steroid called 7d Hydra cholesterol and when that is hit by UVB radiation from the Sun the sun's photons break one of its chemical bonds which convert it to cholecalciferol the science name for vitamin d3 once the d3 is created the liver and kidneys convert that to its final form calciner all process but it all starts with exposure from a nuclear fusion ball millions of miles away that's awesome once created in the kidneys a protein called DVP or vitamin D binding protein grabs it and transports it to the organs where it starts a cascade of effects from building bones by balancing the calcium and phosphate in the body to maintaining nervous system function vitamin D is even essential in helping DNA to express between a hundred and twelve hundred and fifty jeans there are also studies which hypothesize vitamin D or calciner all helps treat autoimmune diseases diabetes infections cognitive degeneration and cancer and can prevent heart disease this stuff is apparently awesome which is why we started putting it everywhere studies in Boston found in 1982 eighty-five percent of children were afflicted with the skeletal devastation that is Ricketts all from a lack of vitamin D so in the nineteen thirties the US government asked food companies -  add vitamin D or cod liver oil to their products in a process called fortification hoping to eradicate the ricketts problem milk and cereal producers have been adding vitamin D their move juice and flakes ever since and it has worked as Ricketts has been virtually eliminated in most of the West today the thing is remember there are five forms of vitamin D and food processors don't add d3 the stuff we make in our skin they add a different version d - ergo Kosta for all plant vitamin D not animal allegedly our body treats them both the same though that debate is on going with some scientists saying it's less efficient for the body to convert so you need more than if you just went outside you can get all the d3 you need with his little as 5 to 15 minutes of direct sunlight on your hands arms and face so for all the chatter and praise vitamin D gets from the media you just make it however if you're worried yeah you can have too much but it's hard vitamin D toxicity is more of a risk for people taking vitamin supplements and can cause an increase in calcium levels which results in heart arrhythmias decreased appetite and increased urination it can even cause nausea vomiting disorientation and the like your body is trying to get all of that excess calcium out but you have to drink more than 40 cups of milk per day to exceed the maximum daily dose so it's more important to be careful with calcium supplements instead which again rd to not be three they work but remember there's a debate vitamin D is just one of many vitamins and minerals the body needs every single day it really struck me that the process of making it from the Sun is super complicated evolution is amazing speaking of all those vitamins do they really improve your health check out this video to find out smokers were given a daily supplement vitamin E beta carotene both or placebo the group taking the supplements were more likely to die of lung cancer or heart disease in the second study the group that took supplements were dying from lung cancer at a rate twenty percent higher than those who didn't you stand in the Sun for five minutes or more a day or would you rather just take a pill and drink some milk let us know in the comments make sure you subscribe for more dnews and we'll see you next time

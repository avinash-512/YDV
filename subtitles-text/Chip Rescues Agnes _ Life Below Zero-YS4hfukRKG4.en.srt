my back he's got coolant all over the ground i was just wondering if you just double up and keep going around on part because we're almost here even in the delivery finished the delivery going to look at this thing will come back here with at least one strap pick this up and I'll drag you home tonight yeah that's how we work in pairs we help each other out you know wherever we need a extra hand here but today it looks like I'm going to be needing the hand to get back home I don't think we're gonna have time today to stop and direct everything but that's alright it adds an extra day to what we want to be doing but they're the kind of people that could put out that extra turned out better than I thought actually and this guy here in one piece I'll get a little shaky but will reinforce it again just because we're snow machine down don't mean we can finish up with what we started we finish the job now we go back and go start a new unexpected job will be a mechanic ii will get this home will call it a day long day already this morning was long enough this afternoon was long enough we still got a 40 mile ride home

nutri are rodents that were first brought to America to be farmed for their thick fur now they're hunted for their meat but to find them Thoren has to head downriver to the marshlands fortunately for me I already have a boat i'm just trying to make it actually river worthy problem is that it's been over a year since I built this and so this is like to a resurrection there's two really large holes that are going to need patching of what i'd like to do is make some pine pitch glue but I want to do it in a large volume so i'm going to make killed where I can cook a lot of time hearts I think that'll work here we go every single time I've gone onion this year its terminus really and I know Delia is depending on this food so this nutrient time is really a chance to show Delia that i can get me when I say that I'm going to get it have to let this get really hot here comes some is that resin heats up it becomes liquid comes out and then it'll run down into the ramp and then go into the cut once I've got the pitch and my pitch pot I can then stir in charcoal and that'll make it stronger and I can make glue the coracle or a bowl boat is a pretty ancient design basically the idea is that a person just makes a basket and you put hide right over it hopefully pine pitch glue will make a waterproof patch will be taking on water through all these holes the only time i'm going to find out if it works is when it gets put in the water so i just have to see what happens

yeah one of those days where the humidity so hot that the air is sweating it's about 20 degrees above room temperature every time I glanced at their ever i'm thinking i sure would like to go down here enjoy some of that cold water there's no rest for the weary especially for frontiersman Colbert who single-handedly building a cabin in the middle of the Georgia swamps I think that work this is going to be the handrail on the porch nice pretty piece of driftwood whether the heartwood of an old twisted surface tree I've got it started getting foundation I've got something to build on all of this is a result of months of rebuilding to get the mainframe up in a few weeks to get the roof on and get the port started I like building where I take the material that I find that I have an interest in and try to figure out where it best fits this is bent from about right here on rather than straighten it out i'm going to take advantage of that curve right here at a fascinating . every tree in the forest is a little bit bent a little bit crooked so if the cabin is a little bit crooked a little bit vent it'll fit right in I've got together a lot more materials to finish my cabin part of what I'll get will be in the forest but i'll still have to buy some of the materials with the need for building supplies on his mind whoa that's a really big beaver frontiersman Colbert counts on transforming a catch in the currency the last many weeks I've been doing a combination of building and collecting a lot of first just one is easy as it looks he's got a nice built that all that up to bring a good price the money I get from it will be invested in supplies to rebuild it's a challenge rebuilding your life when some disaster happens but it gives you an opportunity to redo it again maybe a little better a little different the quest for beaver pelts another animal fur helped fuel the North American economy and further expansion into the new world in the search for untouched hunting grounds today some eighty percent of furs come from animals raised on fur farms it's a 40 billion dollar industry worldwide what I've done is cleaned off all the meeting tissue so that the weather will dry thoroughly it's a really nice fur that the next step so this doesn't dry all wrinkled up and stretch it on this board this belt right here is for somewhere between 8 and 15 times the price of a record help so just from a practical standpoint that makes them really efficient catch so that's finished I'd it'll dry out look like cardboard as you bring top money for the / industry

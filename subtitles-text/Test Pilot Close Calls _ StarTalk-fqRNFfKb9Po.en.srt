oh my god you become a national I'll I a I dreamt about being an ass I was a little boy watching you on strong in bus walking away I was six but unlike Chris I kind of forgot about the dream until I got older and once I get outta college I I decided that I wanted to try to do went to graduate school got me PhD in started applying while I was in grad so you be as a mission specialist which correctly academic writer chris Christie with the pilot route so he's the right stuff yeah like Hal Jordan and then what are you the wrong couple apparently hit me up on what I say the fighter pilot yet we learned about the other part he's got a really cool mustache to he's fascism come nearly a dozen really could not really talk 98 its right now it's a real much that he's Canadian little bit more about christmas background yeah Chris he's into seriously dangerous stuff correctly test pilot yep as a test pilot I had we had one friend I years for like 10 years willie Mae qualified people because that was a dangerous profession we hear every day planned space once every six or seven years so at least the frequency risk is lower but when we look back now to what the rest was on my first shuttle launch the risk of death during asset was about 138 Wi Fi with a lot better than that but now learning everything we knew it was extremely risky thing to do but you just you go okay this is going to be risky but it's worth it now my job is to not die doing this how we spend the next three years learning so much about that no matter what happens we have a plan or gonna react so that we improve our eyes a slight gonna take it that since you are here with me now you didn't die in an hour I came close of the times but did a parachute if you can I've never had to jump out or come close I i here to us I was during testing production river maryland just over the chesapeake and we're calibrating this version F-eighteen fifty feet above the water going 515 us and hit a seagull yen's if you an inch or two over your country when screening cialis both but he just went down the left side too much damage the airplane but you know a couple close calls like that so I'm in both was illegal and 550 miles an hour yeah it's a cannonball at that point there inducing or any good but the airplane and I survived why so that's not even a fall to the you're playing minute when I think you a risk that fire quality and I think even my flying to receive well that israel has I can you know some the riskiest things I did in spaceships other random ones also you know the peppering love debris from natural and man-made from space it's something you just can't do anything about but it's a definite measurable perceptible rest

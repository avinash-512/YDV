welcome back to Startalk we're featuring my interview with actress Miami Alec she is the neuroscientist on the hit TV series The Big Bang Theory and I asked her about the portrayal of women scientists is a good is it bad is it working let's check it out but we did an episode where Bernadette poses for a sexy scientists photo shoot and amy has a very big problem remember that and it's something that I'm asked about a lot because I do advocacy for stem and young women and I'm often asked you know what do you think about the you know the white starched shirt open with the black bra on the glasses down on the red lips and you know and to me I I don't knock women or scientists who want to do that for me that's not the way that I choose to portray women in science you know I don't think we need to take our clothes off you know to show that women in science can also take their clothes off but i think you know part of the advocacy that I try and do is to put a fresh face you know A+ face and a female face on these subjects i think that a lot of also what's missing from trying to engage young women is not just the sex factor or the attractiveness factor which i do agree might be more important in in this day and age then it might have been 10 or 20 or 50 years ago but I think also that a lot of women don't know the kinds of careers that are available to them and people picture themselves or at least I did I don't want to be alone in the lab for the rest of my life I don't want to be energy lab coat and ugly glasses for the restaurant and that's what when I was in elementary school junior high that's what i thought it was but when I got older and I understood Oh marine biology is actually being a scientist working in the field working with animals working in the environment you know all those things are also science if you like engineering and you want to do coding not yourself out but there are many careers that involve a lot of creativity and a lot of being out and about and that's I think what we need to try and communicate to girls as young as possible

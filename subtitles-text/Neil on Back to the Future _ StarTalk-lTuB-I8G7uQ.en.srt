sci-fi geeks surely know this but I don't know how widespread it is in the rest of the population that the second installment of the Back to the Future trilogy there's a scene that takes place in the future on October 21st way in the year 2015 well that's right now that's now and so you get to see the creativity of the futurists of 1989 imagining the future that Marty McFly walks into of course they have flying cars which i think we'll never have but perhaps more intriguing than even the flying car is the flying skateboard that idea a triggered engineers to try to create something like a hoverboard I think science fiction at its best will have such a tantalizing idea that's just out of reach of your technology that you will stimulate research of people who want to create that future that had just been imagined what futurist tend to get wrong is they see what is going on around them and in their extrapolation they just want to trump up what that is imagining the just more of it in the future nineteen eighties fax machines were did everybody had a fax machine want to send a document to me here's back sit well with faxes be in the future well in your home you wouldn't have just one fax machine you have three and so Marty gets fired from his job and he's notified by his boss with Max is that come out of all the fax machines of US homes free fax machines is not three times better than one fax machine and today nobody has a fax machine that was before most people had email and before the concept of an attachment was perfected predictions 10 to focus on extrapolating from what is rather than imagining what could come in out of a field perhaps the most impossible prediction they made was Cubs sweet the World Series have not won the World Series since 1908 so we'll see right now as of this recording the Cubs have entered the playoffs will see as the prophecy of Back to the Future two is fulfilled

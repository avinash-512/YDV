oh my galaxy without gravitational waves yeah hey stargazers Julia here for dnews a long time ago in a galaxy far far away two black holes collided in a fateful swirly waltz just like when you toss a rock into a pond and the kerplunk creates ripples on the surface of the water this collision sent ripples through the fabric of space-time and we finally detected one of these ripples or as researchers call them gravitational waves we've been looking for these kinds of waves for a long time albert einstein first proposed their existence in his theory of relativity over a hundred years ago so we've been searching for them ever since and just how the ripples in the pond gets smaller as they move further from their car plug . the ripples in space-time gets smaller - that's why they're so hard to detect until now today ligo or the laser interferometer gravitational-wave Observatory announced that they found the Galactic kerplunk by detecting or hearing one of the ripples Shh listen music to my ears the signal was seen on September 14th last year but the cataclysmic event that caused it happen nearly 1.3 billion years ago when two black holes well two black holes colliding has been theorized it hasn't been observed before the theory goes that two black holes will circle each other and lose energy that's released as gravitational waves over time they will get closer and closer over the course of a few billion years then finally collide in a fraction of a second this release is a large amount of masses energy in the form of gravitational waves in this case the black holes were about 30 times the mass of our Sun and we're moving at half the speed of light in that last fraction this huge impact sent a shock wave of gravitational waves or ripples in space-time through the universe at the speed of but as massive as that collision was the reverberations that reached us for tiny like 11 thousand the diameter of a proton according to David Wright see the executive director of ligo like Oh was able to detect such a tiny wiggle by using two labs one in Livingston Louisiana and one in hand for Washington the labs use massive and precise lasers like 2.5 mile long laser beams that can read ten thousand times smaller than a proton these lasers were fired into two l-shaped pipes that sounds light around a series of mirrors a strain and space-time would change the timing of when the lasers reach their destination and that's just what happened on that fateful day the same wiggle showed up on the detectors in the two labs just seven milliseconds apart and more incredible these Wiggles matched up to what super computer models of gravitational waves had already predicted which were based off of the calculations from Einstein's theory of so it's the real deal we now have solid evidence of gravitational waves and evidence and binary black holes and this discovery proves Einstein's finally we've been searching for these guys for a century rumors have it that this discovery could make the shortlist for a Nobel Prize why well researchers are hailing that the discovery could be as exciting as when we discovered x-rays like oh co founder says that has open a new window onto the universe studying and tracking gravitational waves will help us better understand black holes supernovas other really large space events and even possibly the fundamental laws of the universe will learn so much more about the universe and how it works as i go upgrade their equipment to become more and more sensitive and in a few decades the european space agency plans to launch a space-based gravitational wave detector so hopefully more gravitational waves will be if you want to learn more about this amazing discovery check out the study published in the journal Physical Review Letters Wow Wow guys so much incredible science happening right now in our lifetime instead would be so proud of gravitational wave seem like a familiar concept it's because we talked about them before on dnews a telescope called bicep2 is looking for evidence of gravitational waves of a different kind from the most cataclysmic event of all time the big bang to learn more about that check out these episodes right here these waves were predicted by Einstein and in a nutshell his equation predicted that should a massive object like a black hole or neutron star suddenly accelerate decelerate or collide and it should be lost but in these cosmic scenarios energy is lost through powerful ripples in space-time much like the ripples that race across surface of home after pebbles hits the water so how excited are you guys about this new tell us down in the comments below don't forget to hit those like and subscribe buttons and keep coming back to dnews we've got new episodes every day of the week

Capturing the Beauty of Africaâ€™s Wildlife and Fighting to Save It anybody who spent time under the stars like this in Botswana really understands anybody's listen to this call and knows it will know why we fell in love with Africa and and and if the night sounds go quiet it won't only be the leopard and the lines that we will be using it will be pretty much everything for wildlife and huge part of our own soul so this is a pivotal moment in and sadly the battle is against ignorance and greed in Africa this battle is going to be fought around three major species elephants that reducing at a rate of five an hour lions at reducing the duration of five everyday and their Honors we lose one every six point three hours every day when these animals like think people will stop coming can indeed the communities or suffer in fact all economies will go down so what we like to face on is the beauty john keats wrote that beauty is truth and truth is beauty and that's what we embody in all I work in our forms and the empathy that we have when something unfold in front of us and this little scene happened a couple of months ago two lionesses wanted to cross the river with their cubs but of course they saw the ripples of a crocodile going by and you could feel the tension and then of course a little later hippos came by so that's really freaky little Cubs and they didn't want to go classic the line is were determined they needed to get across and so they managed to get in the water and they got some of the Cubs to follow with them and straight away the little Cubs dodged to their side of the bank again let's talk 12 hours the whole day and eventually the lionesses got the Cubs to go in but only when they were murdered way did they realize that only for cabs with them but they had to keep going forward and so they went forward got to the opposite side of the bank deposit of those Cubs only two here on the other side the other cuts of cording and so they had to recon front that crocodile-infested River and go back again and of course the Cubs on the other side were truly to see their mothers and wanted to play but the Cubs their mothers now heard the other Cubs on the other side and so they were in a deliverer and they had to try and sort the South they crossed it seven times that day and eventually at dusk they cross the one last time and as they crossed the one last time the two little Cubs refused to go and they had to leave these two cups on the other side and they went and obviously the tension in the vehicle between Derek and our with extreme so it was not going to go into a 24 hour journey for these Cubs and we waited and they waited and at early dawn to two lionesses came back but this time they were almost glued together for their own protection and there was so silent and this is what happened yeah we were thrown so we use beautiful stories like this sometimes to get our message across and in this case we treated this we used instagram we use it on facebook and rent out to two million people immediately because everybody was just engaged with this we realized it just the other day that something quite magical has started to happen and in fact people are now taking to the streets this is a march four lions a global March that takes place in 32 cities across the globe right who would ever have thought that something like this could ever even happened so Beverly was talking about the ignorance and greed something that happened in kenya recently is really fighting ignorance as we stirred at these piles of ivory being burned we stood in silent memory of the elephants that we've known and the ones that we will never know and I think it's important to know that inside these piles of ivory 11 piles of ivory was a lot of confiscated big cat skins lions leopards and cheetah what's happening to elephants is happening to the cats and then who would have thought that the military would be working with us to protect reiners to relocate them to a safe haven in so the goal is to combat greed and to secure a large protected landscapes with a big cat work we've had the opportunity to really focus on what works and what doesn't work and we've come down to the notion that there are four major causes of d clients twenty-five percent of the d clients on the cats its habitat loss so it's ultimately important to protect wild landscapes poaching is another major pillar of these d clients and so we spent four and a half months heading up the river from the Okavango to the northern river systems in the northern part of checking on poaching the good news is this is the highest density of elephants in the world and the purchase is very the bad uses the rent always happy to see you so we've spent the last 35 years forming and focusing all our attention on the big cats protecting these magnificent creatures how can you not be in all how can anybody not been all of this amazing line but they've led us on a journey so six years ago we were shocked when we discovered that we were losing ninety-five percent of all these cats in just 50 years that's alarming and so that's where we co-founded the big cat initiative was national geographic and as you can see we now have great progress we have 91 projects in 27 countries many of them are right through Africa we've managed to give out over three million u.s. dollars in grants so all our goal is to now protect these last living and thriving big cats we need to be successful one of the other big pillars of decline is hunting so we still lose 660 largely male lions a year to the hunting industry and a lot of that comes into the USA 1.2 million trophies in the last 10 years into the United States so we've reached out and we try to do whatever we can in this regard and we've spoken to governments around the world we're already starting to see some very very interesting things at this crossroads the US government has has announced that they will be restricting line trophies coming into the United States similar conversations are happening in Australia in netherlands european community everything is now starting to close down we spoken to Airlines we started this conversation Valens there are 42 airlines today that refused to carry hunting trophies so there we are having quite an impact and that's what we said pleased about and then we need to look at the successes in Africa there has been some policy changes in what's wanna stopped all line hand thing and then in 2011 stopped all efforts hunting 2014 they decided no hunting completely shut down uganda followed in the footsteps of botswana and they stopped big head hunting and now all hunting is a sedan followed and they have now stopped all hunting a little different with South Africa South Africa's put a moratorium on leopards for a year but that shows that we can't be complacent we need to drive forward the fourth people of course is communities that are live next to these big wildlife populations and are in conflict within we have a number of grantees that are working with communities largely to reduce the conflict with cattle communities like the Messiah for instance one particular innovative project that we came across is in d redirecting the this young warrior instinct to go out and to kill a line and we trying to find with them new ways to direct that energy even though it's a very very ancient activity so this is a race against time what we have to do stop all killings we have to stop all conflicts and we need to mount a major campaign to stop all the trade in animal parts for us to be within a year of Cecil the lion in Zimbabwe been killed there would be marches in the streets it would be governed policy's being changed it would be airlines stopping trophy hunting and so for us there's never been a time when the pass in this crossroads has been clearer thank you very much

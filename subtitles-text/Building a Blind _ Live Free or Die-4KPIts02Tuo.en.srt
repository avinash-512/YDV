Building a Blind _ Live Free or Die haha right here fresh ones look yeah cool there's a whole bunch action it's not like one do that's a bunch of you or one deer is coming here all the time yeah if this is where they're hanging out then we just need to get to a spot where we can see them but they can't see us right I think just on the other side of this corridor here ok you can stalk a deer but that's really tough I have no idea how to do that for me a lot more practical to figure out where the deer live and then make a little spot next door to hang out and hide and watch and wait for the deer want to go check out this corn crib over here in 10 might be able to use for a room yeah you can dry I don't know so we can do alright cool it feels normal to me because it's how I've grown up for Tony this is his first time but I think Tony is a natural inclination and natural skills as a hunter could build this blind to get out of the rain this looks like an old corn crib you see the slats of wood in the wire mesh has to keep verma nail this was for animal feed and regrets and whatnot and some old nails these will be useful for fifteen nails and poles together we can use these and banging with a rock wanna grab some of his 10 so we can make a little roof looks good this yeah i work all about keeping stuff out of the landfill and repurposing it and giving it a new incarnation slide a piece of framing up underneath there they're definitely invites creativity and it feels good to give way to live let me get back and see what it maybe sit down inside for a second sit down in there looks kind of comfort and my dear ok all right let me see let me see all right i'm a deer I'm a dare you see me yep yep I can see you so here's something but I don't see anything yeah I if I needed to show you I could definitely see that from you're okay okay perfect I'm glad I'm not a dare

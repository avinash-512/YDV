yeah food has been pretty minimal in the canyon here so i'm heading to this other creek area hoping to do some fishing and I'm also just interested to get into a new area try to find some other food sources and just get out and explore a little bit for a little adventure victory is short-lived in the wilds of Arizona's canyons for desert Nomad Tobias it's only as good as his last meal out here there's no surplus there's no having abundance for the future it's really just trying to figure it all out I think there's other places where what I'm trying to do would be easier there's just kind of more abundance of the kind of food that humans need to survive for humans this is a tough environment yeah I think I've always been drawn to traditional skills and I didn't always know what that meant or what it looked like as a kid I was always trying to go out and hunt and gather in the woods I just wasn't very successful but now that i have more exposure to that kind of understand that what I was interested in was his prehistoric skills that really paved the way for all other I hear water excited to go get a drink made it with a water source you just get all this diversity of life I'm hoping that this area is more abundant for finding food oh my goal is to get some fish today hopefully so gonna make a sphere looking for a spear fishing spear and this thicket of willow has a nice tall straight pieces like take a poll kind of like this and split the end open the spear is really easy to make so it's something simple i didn't have to carry it with me and they're pretty effective and really low-tech so simple is better so this is probably 10 feet which is not bad and now what I'm going to do is try to split this and into fourths so it'll basically become like a four-pronged spear ok so i put this in it will spread those apart that pretty this we're good now i just need to find some fish

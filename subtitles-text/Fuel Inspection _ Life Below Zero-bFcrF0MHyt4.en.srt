winners not waiting on me to be ready it's here what I need to do is get all my jet fuel barrels get them over to the fuel said to get filled get as many pallets as i can and get those over by he tink I need to get it where it needs to live for the winter to make it the easiest closest for me when the conditions are brutally cold and brutally dark he was going to take a quick look at my barrels what a project four barrels go on a pallet in order for me to have enough fuel for the entire that's 48 barrels I have to individually look at each Merrill say yes or no to it see if they're empty if they're not verify what's in it check it out make sure there's no holes even a pinhole leak it's a protected ecosystem you can't leak fuel out all over it's just not the way it's done so i have to visually inspect each year each barrel this is a no bad ones are over why are they bad well this one has a hole in it this one's beat up really dang bad looks like it's been that way for a while like here's a ding but it's not a whole but if I need 48 barrels I've gotta do 48 inspections you know I'm getting colder and my well below zero no but now is the time to get everything where it needs to be I have to continue my process on getting the barrels where they need to live because overnight I can drop below zero within a couple weeks I'm gonna be dark I got 48 not are free of holes free of things that will compromise the integrity of the barrel next step for me though for this get to work start pumping field

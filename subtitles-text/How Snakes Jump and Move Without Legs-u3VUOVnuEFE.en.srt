thanks why didn't have to be snakes because they're awesome hey guys Julia here for dnews well some people are absolutely terrified of snakes I actually really love them they're some of the most fascinating animals on this planet I mean just how did they get about without any legs well to answer that we first have to understand a little bit more about their evolutionary history snakes appear on almost every continent in almost every country except famously Ireland a study published in the Journal of vertebrate paleontology found that stinks probably evolved from a four-legged lizard which another study suggests happens sometimes during the Jurassic period around a hundred fifty million years ago researchers believe that they probably lost their legs to adapt to moving in narrow underground burrows it's not that leg simply got in the way recently the journal Science Foundation so-called missing link between lizards and snakes tetrapod office and lectus hails from what's now South America and lived during the Cretaceous these creatures are supposed to be distant cousins of what we know to be snakes they had a long body a small tail and for little limbs that were used for grasping prey to this day you can actually still see best digital leg bones and some steaks like pay phones and boa constrictors without legs makes evolved a few clever ways to move a study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that snake scales are for more than just good looks scales act like a kind of hop to help snake slither across surfaces researchers previously assumed that scales help snakes move across rough surfaces like rocks and tree bark but the scales can't even grasp onto smooth surfaces and fine grains of sand some snakes can move using just their belly scales alone big stakes like pythons and boa constrictors can move in a straight line just by lifting up their undersides enough to grip and push off the ground using their scales this is called rectilinear locomotion but for other types of snakes it takes more than just a few scales to get from point A to point B thanks have segmented muscles that are made for slithering allowing them to glide over a surface and twisting or oscillating motion the typical snake slither you're familiar with is called lateral undulation where they move their segment and muscles in a specific sequential pattern this wave-like motion propels the snake forward in an s-shape when the snake's body contact some sort of fixed point like a rock or depression and ground the snake actually uses this fixed point to kind of push off and move forward if the environment is lacking these kinds of resistance . a snake might use a sign widening motion like the creatively named Sidewinder this movement is similar to lateral undulation except well late sideways and only two points of the snake's body are touching the ground at any time so it's an incredibly fast way to get around in fact it's reported that a sidewinder can reach up to 18 miles per hour snakes can also climb trees using what's called concertina locomotion they stretch out their heads and scrunch up their bodies behind them kind of like an accordion unlike lateral undulation their muscles are moved all the ones rather than in a sequence almost makes use more than one of these forms of movement the coolest example of a snake is chrissy Opilio also known as the flying snake these things are not only able to climb trees that can jump from branch to branch according to a integrative and comparative biology when Chris Opilio readies itself for takeoff it contorts its body into a j-shaped before it thrusts up from the branch to become airborne in the area uses lateral undulating motion to stabilize itself and glide gracefully before landing so rather than being afraid of snakes just marvel at how freaking cool flying snakes are even though many snakes are harmless to humans are pair of them remain strong why are we still afraid of snakes Amy finds out in this episode right here i am creeped out that they have no arms or legs that they do that slippery move thing and let's not forget that some of them have fangs dripping with poison snake venom is terrifying alright guys how you feel about snakes are you terrified of them where do you think they're terrific let me know down in the comments below don't forget to hit those like and subscribe button so you don't miss a single dnews episode

it really is just dropping into a world that you don't know what you're gonna find it's scary when you don't know what's going on and then as soon as you see it it turns into something beautiful it doesn't feel totally totally sick so they are still wild animals you never know exactly what they are going to do any of the Sharks tried to fight no but when I was down with black parallely for their unfortunate silvery color and they splash around in the water kind of like fish to go let's try to get pictures of you female blocks what a little too interested in my lasers to Krypton circling around really close by towards the end of the dive she actually came right towards the right in front of me and when I like this trying to get my ladies and I just sort of wave around trying to get them away from her and I quickly got the package my body and then have left me alone yeah she's kind of after my gear part of my drive to come here is to show people in other side of these animals they're they're not just the monster that you'll see in Jaws there they're not really malicious there just no animal trying to survive like a really happy place with you

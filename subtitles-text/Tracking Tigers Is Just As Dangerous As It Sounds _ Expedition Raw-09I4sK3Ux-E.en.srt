we're setting camera traps to study tigers two people got eaten by Tigers right before we started when there's a tiger around you can't sleep you can barely eat you can't do anything because all you are scared for life I've been in Indonesia now for almost a year tracking Tigers through the remaining national parks you can smell Tigers have been on that they're very close it was very distinct smell whenever we thought that there might be one around it was drop everything kind of fear light a fire to do everything we could to never see one the way we monitor where Tigers are is by setting remotely triggered camera traps there's not a single trail and there's really just two options to get through these landscapes one is along a ridge line and the others upper river so climbing up a thousand meters at a 45 degree angle the 70 pound pack we're all exhausted we return two months or three months later and retrieve the memory card and we get to see all the animals yeah northern n and we come across another clear-cut is fresh only six months old maybe like us people come here because the forest department or researchers like me maybe once every five years we would randomly come across the location so if someone claims of people and like this we're gonna get away with it our research has highlighted that Tigers will remain in all sorts of force no matter if they're logged or degraded or fragmented as long as we can control poachy this is their earliest pre-colonial shipwreck ever discovered so to find something like that is like you know this like Hollywood story and help

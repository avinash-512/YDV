people tell me I'm slow yeah well you're slow everybody slow we're all slow for a high slowpokes Julian here for dnews if you've ever raced a cheetah and you're not named Usain Bolt you probably lost or heck even if you tried racing against your cat I bet you still lost from horses to dogs birds it seems the entire Animal Kingdom is faster and stronger than we are why well we evolved to fit into our ecological niche but even compared to our nearest relatives the chimpanzees and bonobos we are considerably weaker we weren't always this way according to Dan Lieberman a biological anthropologist at Harvard University are shipped like ancestor was a power athlete that was much stronger and faster than humans but they had no endurance so we traded our brawn for bigger brains and the ability to outrun our prey in a long-distance hunt when our ancestors of all from being mostly tree dwellers to Savannah walkers they probably trade strength and speed for endurance this is creatively called the endurance hypothesis some researchers believe that humans evolved a unique predatory style rather than a fast and furious chase like a cheetah or vin diesel humans take the slow and steady wear down your prey tell it collapses from exhaustion kind of action and this takes very specific types of muscles by comparison cheetahs have muscles that are tailored to react quickly so they can reach top speeds of around 70 miles per hour but the trade-off is they get exhausted quickly they have no endurance while we can never run that fast we can run for a long time maybe longer than any other animal sure less exciting than a high-speed chase but incredibly effective but you're also slow because you're weak don't feel bad we all are comparatively speaking one of our closest relatives the chimpanzee is about twice as strong as a human because they're arboreal they spend most of their time in trees most of their strength is concentrated in their arms our ancestors probably had similar muscle strength to a chimpanzee around six million years ago according to a study published in PLoS ONE the researchers found that in the few million years since human beings evolved dramatically our brains got bigger specifically in our prefrontal cortex the part that deals with long-term goal planning they found that the prefrontal cortex was radically different in humans than from in chimpanzees monkeys and Mike it seemed to have evolved four times faster than the other parts of the body and this is because in part human started to evolve social structures that allowed us to say work together as a team to take down bigger prey but there is a downside to a bigger brain a bigger brain consumes more energy our brains consume twenty percent of the energy we use which is a lot compared to other animals so where did the energy come from maybe from our muscles the researchers also found our ancestors muscles changed rapidly - very rapidly about eight times faster than the rest of our body so researchers believe that to deal with the energy demands of a bigger brain our ancestors evolved smaller muscles to compensate but more research is needed now you may think this contradicts the Darwinian principles of survival of the fittest but fit in this context doesn't mean physical fitness it means an organism fits and anish long enough to reproduce so the genetic lineage survives and it's not that being a smart wimp is always better than being a big dumb ox or vice versa it's a matter of what's most beneficial for an organism based on its environment and competition if coming down from the trees and learning to make fire means one day your offspring will populate the globe probably worth giving up looking like a species of mr. universes that's evolution so you can't outrun a cheetah but you can definitely out walk it Julia covers the endurance hypothesis in more detail right so what's the evidence for this hypothesis well one is the way we sweat we evolved to chase our food in a really hot climate most animals release excess body heat by pantic well this might help your dog cool down on a hot summer day panting actually gets in the way of breathing if you have the option to be ripped but also conform basic sentences would you take it Master keyboard down in the comments subscribe for more and i will see you next time on

he's like a little kid that's where we're trying to put the first electronic tag on a free-flying migrating monarch butterfly if that works then we could for the first time really follow them in the wild how they migrate and find out exactly how they do it I would start with the left off here the bag is made out of a small battery like a hearing aid battery a little circuit and it just beeps and we received this over the radio in an antenna and that allows us to follow the end taking out they only have a few habitat places if those areas are destroyed then there's no monarch butterflies anymore big boy wow that's big the biggest part of why we've got it her goes it successful the animal doesn't seem to be affected by the tax so they move around normally they just do their regular thing and you can follow party or anything nope lower touch the ground once we locate them from the air we come back we want to find them again you want to see what they're doing here yes that's it yeah ok boys ready to go but Wisconsin find a girlfriend there we go you headed out that way right along the tree line northeast I built this thing from scratch to get aerial shots for conservation research

Richard Dawkins the well-known evolutionary biologist we have him as a guest on Startalk is a leading atheist and it's wild some people cuz he's he's he's blunt about his and-and-and matter of fact it is atheistic ways and this is rubbed people in our modern culture in various ways to champion in some circles and is demonized and others and so I just thought we should unpack that and see what are the forces operating here and what I even challenged them i said are you a little too harsh here can you who you because we often there are common motors common goals but with different tactics if you will in educating the public and so this is a conversation with him about what are his methods and tools in ways i compare that with some of my methods and tools of ways as an educator as a scientist and also in studio we had as a secondary guest a Jesuit priest who is one of these hip priests right he's not if he's coming off flavor this one's like hip and he's he was not quite candid about where he's coming from and what the Catholic Church has stood for over the years and the changes that have been within it so it's an interesting conversation more to enlighten the perspectives of the viewer not to have a knock-down drag-out fight I've never seen televised fights ever enlighten anyone about anything what happens is people choose sides and they become more ossified interviews so Startalk it's never my goal to just sit there and debate people and tell someone whose right it wrong that I'm an educator i'm here to lighten people to empower you to think for yourself if at the end of the day I've accomplished that that was a good day for me

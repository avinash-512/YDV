we will actually send in each crew two men and two women but of course we don't know yet scientists don't know yet if if fertilization works in reduced gravity of Mars so we don't know how fetus will develop in the reduced gravity of Mars so before we have a really long and thin embryo let's let's find out that information first let's build a colony that is safe so maybe 20 or 30 or 40 people living there imagine a toddler running around in a colony with four astronauts living on Mars that's not a good place for a kid to grow up so I was kid there ever was though the first month after Jesus Jesus in the manger comes the child born on Mars had the second-most neighbor's child ever okay that'sthat's crazy but it needs to be done in a in a thoughtful way and i will will be sending very responsible people to Mars and I expect that they will behave responsibly come on the Mars one website it says Mars one will advise the first settlement inhabitants not to attempt to have children at all plus am I not right sperm count drops in zero-g they never told me that look what are you kidding me to assist don't have babies but don't say you can't have sex right that's all well also can you send like a pregnant animal and then see what happens there's my non-human animal yeah yeah no I like a cat or a dolphin or something your golfer yeah I had a time just like a dragon dog at first I just wanted katha someone's internet cats right and yet that will fund it everybody watches the internet kid no that's true said an adorable pregnant cat then that's the solution for raising money but none of this like everyone wants to see the landing beautiful just what I'm presuming the reason he doesn't want them to attempt to reproduce the first cruise because they want to do some kind of testing and experiments yeah i can only get it shows that would almost make sense without crying about being revived right at all right this my first choice would not be having toddlers running around right because they themselves are not good at survival right most of the life of the parent is preventing the toddler from dying am I wrong here parent any parents in there that is the whole job to have them not die that's all I'm saying kids are hard enough to track if you try to keep your own damn self alive if you hadn't yet like you have teenagers at home actually right I think Tim you and your meals ya hear any one thing for toddler to break your dishwasher but to break your thing in outer space with a terrible yeah I told you not to push that button yes

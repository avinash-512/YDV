many people myself included for a while assume that women have a higher tolerance for pain because well we give birth but science actually tells us a completely different story hi guys and gals will set here for dnews now I'm sorry but it's true research shows that men have both a higher pain tolerance and higher threshold for pain and studies women typically report feeling pain much sooner than men and women also tell experimenters to stop the pain that's been inflicted on them much sooner than men do and this all comes from data analyzed in multiple studies that spanned a period of more than a decade many of which have been published in the Journal of now researchers study painting using all kinds of tortures methods some of the more common ways they inflict pain on participants include putting really cold things directly on the skin administering electric shocks and putting a lot of physical pressure on different parts of the participants body in one study at the University of lincoln in the UK researchers subjected 24 men and 26 women too cold presses and measure their responses consistent with other studies they found that women had a lower tolerance and lower threshold for pain compared to men but the scientists took the study even further when the researchers told the participants to focus on the physical components of the pain it help decrease the pain felt for men but not for women and when they ask them to focus on the emotional aspects of the it made the pain feel worse for women but not for men so for women it's like a double whammy they seem to feel more pain were quickly and have a harder time coping with it too but what's important to keep in mind is that most of these studies rely on self-reports which means they are susceptible to bias ease pain is largely defined by science as subjective we rely on people to tell us how much pain they feel and when they feel it as opposed to measuring it more directly like we do with height or weight not surprisingly studies have found that social factors influence these reports of pain and the gender difference we see in one study published in cross-cultural research on college students from both India and the u.s. researchers found that Americans were more willing to express that they're in pain than their indian counterparts and this is reflected in how much pain they reported American students tolerated less pain than indian meaning that both sets of students could have been feeling the same I mean but for cultural reasons one group expressed it quicker than the other on top of that things like who's conducting the experiment seemed to matter to in another recent study published in the journal researchers had 80 male and a female participants put their hands and icy cold water to measure their tolerance but the researchers split the participants so half of them had the test conducted by someone of the same sex and have had someone of the opposite sex the study found that how long they kept their hand underwater significantly varied depending on whether the experimenter was a man or a woman have tested by the opposite sex they lasted much longer clearly there are mediating social factors that influence pain but this doesn't mean biology doesn't play a role to another study published in the journal pain measured pay not by asking the participants how much pain he felt but by measuring how their people's behaved with infrared technology researchers hypothesize that the amount of ppl dilated directly correlated with how much pain they were in and conditions of high pressure or pain women's pupils dilated much more than this matters because it's not like the participants could manipulate how much their pupils are dilating this is a completely involuntary biological reaction so it might just be that men and women feel pain differently but some men and women don't feel pain at all find out why in this video nerve cells communicate by sodium ions as these ions get passed through channels from one cell to the next the pain signals travel from the injury site where it's felt up the spinal cord and into the brain but a mutation in the SC and nine a gene stops these channels called nab one point seven channels from forming so what do you think about the research do you have any qualms let us know in the comments below and remember to subscribe to dnews for more episodes yeah

I don't think I'll ever get used to putting my finger up a water bug famous hey buddy hi I'm apologizing it's one less thing you have to be to the local we want to know what effect the animals are having on this ecosystem and to do that I have to know what they're eating to find out what they're eating i have to look at their group of pellets she's when you get a pickle stuff we don't mess around just want to be as thorough as possible in Gorongosa National Park most of the wildlife was wiped out during the Mozambique and civil war you want to start on the measurements and I'll water back on the other hand have become 10 times more abundant than they were before the Civil War if we want to understand why the water back or doing so well we have to know what their daily lives are like the best way to do that is not just collecting fruit but also these Crittercam colors little movie it generally takes us less than 10 minutes to go through the whole process and then administer the reversal drug so they wake up right away you know if you were abducted by aliens and you don't really remember any of it imagine that's how I water but feels after this is barry how much was still in there for me again when the animal wakes up and walks off the color you'll start logging their GPS locations and the cameras will start shooting video it's giving us a totally unprecedented view of life as a water buck

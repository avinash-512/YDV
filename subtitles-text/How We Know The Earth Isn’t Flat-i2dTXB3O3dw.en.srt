earth looks lat and feels flat the logical explanation is the earth is flat right but like once you get past the crazy talk how do we know the earth is round welcome back my woke friends trace here for dnews if you follow the pervasive yellow journalism online and elsewhere you've probably heard of rapper b.o.b is beef with NASA science and specifically dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson astrophysicist and science lab love Neil in short some pop culture peeps think that the earth is flat proving them wrong is simple though it took hundreds of years for science to figure it out in the first place we know the earth is round by observing it closely if you watch a ship as it disappears over the horizon the bottom will vanish first and then the top disappears later it looks like it's sinking kind of that's because the earth is curved using a stopwatch you can do your own experiment to prove it watch the Sun set over the ocean or an open plain with a friend if you stand while they lay down each will see the Sun cross the horizon is a slightly different time the Greeks first realized this 2,500 years ago and spent hundreds of years attempting to explain it first mathematician pythagoras looked at the moon and discovered a curve in the line dividing the light from the shadow on its surface that line is called The Terminator a flat moon would have a straight line the only explanation the moon must be a sphere sometime later an accident horas while watching the moon during an eclipse realize the shadow covering the that must be coming from the earth and that shadow was definitely curved so the earth must be around and still later in about 350 BC Aristotle noted that star constellations that were visible in Greece were hidden beyond the horizon in Egypt his conclusion yet again was the earth must be a sphere just like the moon sidebar notice humanity knew the earth was around 1800 years before 1492 in columbus sailed the ocean blue just debunking some great school crap don't worry about once these great thinkers realize the earth was curved they wanted to prove a Greek astronomer named rasta themes figured it out on the summer solstice the sun reaches a peak at the top of the sky rasta things went to two distant locations in Egypt on the solstice and measured shadows cast by tall towers in each place then using some geometry you can calculate the curvature of the earth between those two places from there he could extrapolate how many degrees the circle of the earth he has moved ultimately revealing the circumference and diameter of the whole planet dang rasta themes thanks to all these ancient humans we know the earth is just a bit over 40,000 kilometers around the poles which is also supported by modern observations and knowing that we can determine how far the horizon is from you at any given point which changes depending on how high above sea level you are the earth is curved and we know it in the end the problem is flatter thurs don't trust science when the flat earth society was founded in the mid-1920s the idea was that observation trumps all this is called The Satanic philosophy many skeptics believe the same you can see it all over the internet if the earth looks flat it must be flat and often the skeptics cry prove me wrong only trust your own observations the funny thing about that argument is that it was observation that showed us the Earth's curvature in the first Pythagoras observed that shadow line across the moon countless people have observed ships sailing underneath the horizon not to mention the fact that we've gone to space and observed a very spiritual earth from above and if you don't believe all of those scientists and government people for some reason go make your own observation climb a mountain watch a ship sail over the horizon watch the sunset with a friend flying an airplane and behold and in arguably spherical earth your move Bob conspiracy theories are just the best aren't they have you ever wondered why people love 911 conspiracies or why were so obsessed with the Illuminati or which conspiracy theories might actually be true check out test-tube plus my other show we talked about that for a whole week we covered all of those topics and more check it out the thing about 9 11 though is we didn't expect it to happen so there was a lot of mis reporting on that day there were bombs on the ground to some people said there were other planes in the air some people said there were car bombs parked outside of buildings some people said you guys know anything else we should make a video debunking let us know down in the comments and come back here every day for more dnews yeah

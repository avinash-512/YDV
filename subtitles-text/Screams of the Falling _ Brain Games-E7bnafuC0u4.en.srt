we've got a surprise in store for our competitors are cognitive challenges were missing one critical element of survival situations stress what you're gonna do is you're gonna go up the stairs just follow the path over to that plank ok I have no idea where this is going we lead our volunteers to the edge of a 700-foot canyon and offer them a seat holy cow so how's it feel so far five has a comfortable chair good beautiful day it's a controlled environment this has happened so many times before there's nothing to be afraid of right see he's trying to rationalize yeah dropping me the danger of this stunt exists only in the imagination of the players but dr. Bart predicts the reactions to the perceived threat will be totally real I think a lot of chemicals are going through right now anticipation of what's about to happen  our expert is even willing to join travis when his weight requires a second person for balance this is nuts dude explain me what's going to happen them and take the fun out of it and while he was like a little tip before we go tip yep sure oh that kind of tip down Oh more that just a couple seconds it takes only three seconds to follow to be a piss but how fast can are survivors recover their bearings well as a good one yet done yet oh I'm done Dana

a group of biologist studying humpback whales at the Stellwagen bank national marine sanctuary invited the critter cam team to join them in their research critter cams are a small computer controlled camera system we used to study animal behavior in their natural environment the critter cams on a section cup mount added the end of this long pole boom attached so now you're seeing the view of humpbacks world from riding on his back so the researchers have put 3d motion tags on whales here and they've gotten records of this odd twisting rolling behavior that's happening well below the surface where they can't see but they're not really sure what it is they're thinking it's probably feeding of some sort but they can't be certain now by using the critter cam we can figure out what's really going on is it feeling like they thought or is it something else completely so the critter cams on and we're getting this great view of what the whales doing and here it begins to go to the surface to get a breath and as it does it runs into this other whale and the crew game gets caught between the two and it almost gets knocked off its mount you can see the front bracket in the shot now luckily the second bracket held in the camera state on as the whale dies towards the bottom it gets a lot darker so the cameras kind of straining to see in the slow light and here we actually enhance the image so we can see the detail better and it gets a bit grainy you'll come in you'll see the the whale rotates as it approaches the bottom it's rolling on its side and the camera twists actually so it's pointed downwards and you see these little sand lance fish swarming all over the bottom that's the pray that the whales going after but they're not actually buried and so the whales are skimming right up along the bottom of the sea but they're not actually digging into it this bottom feeding behavior could be sometimes done by a whale by itself and sometimes multiple Wales working together and so that's the level of detail that the visuals can give us that some of these other devices can't this next shot is just fun while the Wells running the critic am it breached it leapt up out of the water crashing back down this is pretty cool to watch from outside the whales perspective but to see it like this is just amazing

the game engines are all along the side of the rim we're walking along the summit of Mount Ranier on our way to the east crater cave to make a three-dimensional map if someone gets lost or hurt it's easier to conduct a search and rescue operation yeah some of the edges are great speech you could take a 40-foot freefall followed by several hundred feet of tumbling into toxic air waiting for you at the very bottom we're in the creator of the episodic Lee active volcano so this is not the place that many people go to have fun is everybody okay rule number one don't get hurt my nerves are up the whole time I'm inside the cave this was this is fine but down here is not when you hear the beeps go off it means you're in a very dangerous level or carbon dioxide and you have to leave right away or a need to go unconscious and I right there where you're living at the risks are undertaking is worth it to the McKay's are very unique we're looking at a couple of different things but they Center on possible microbial life that lives and these caves a blend of volcanic gases mixing with a high altitude dark I ck replicates what they expect to find on Europa the Martian ice caps or other ice body somewhere in the solar system I sense together it's a very exciting alien environment draws you in but we just basically skim the surface which is why we're going to be coming back for many years to come all of a sudden it just started raining down on top of me one of us are all of us just the are in kicks or just the pressure waves of our body must have set off this challenge

we do get captivated by media by the attention drawn to other countries to the big animals that are better being slaughtered by poachers and we do forget that we have the same problems going on in our backyard whenever out we see a deer lane and field that's been killed in the middle and I with its antlers cutoff makes you sick but I think we forget how often it happens here how often it happens around us in those times when there is a conviction when the poacher is brought to justice I feel like we've all been able to speak for the ones that can't be heard for the animals are the ones that have been taken illegally because it's stealing from all of us when a poacher kills an animal they have stolen from every single one of us I keep doing this job because I believe in it because i believe it's the right thing today because someday I want my children to be able to say mom did what she believed in she push hard and she gave it everything she had had a good time along with God

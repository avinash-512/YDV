this is my first major expedition so this is the dream right it's a bit hairy to actually get on for my main job is to get aerial shots for conservation research this expedition happened in 2012 and even though it doesn't seem like that long ago drone technology was a lot different than it is today you . just five really nice flyball off the shelf groans I built this thing from scratch at one point I was even pretty much just sleeping in the office to make sure that i could get this thing done there anything special you want my it's very very windy the seabirds you can see their kind of just like hovering there in this immense amount of wind so I decide all right I'm gonna kind of do this cool banking turn maybe look at some seabirds the frame artistic and everything but the drone is turning as I'm making this maneuver so it's turning but then the wind catches it I'm really trying not to let anybody know but I'm really freaking out inside and what is happening with his drone could cut the engines and let it fall to the ground it'll be fine it'll be fine i'm telling myself and so I close to the tree line and on the other side is this big rocky beach lasted how long 30 seconds pretty much the drone fell into the ocean and they got smashed to bits on the rocks in the lesson learned like my bosses just don't crash it I am with Alex Honnold and we are attempting to client 45 of the most iconic towers in the desert

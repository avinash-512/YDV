when you swim into one of these Springs and then a manatee comes around the corner it's like everything slows down and takes a breath it sometimes will swim right up to you you can count the whiskers on its face receive the propeller marks on its back about 20 minutes you write down here i'm an eighth-generation floridian I still feel like I'm connected to the Florida from the eighteen hundreds to the stories of my grandparents and great-grandparents and I feel responsibility for the future of florida because of my heritage in connection with your leg is not soft down here in Florida Wildlife quarter expeditions were not an arbitrary walk in the woods we are following the paths of wildlife as determined by the latest research trying to bring attention to the corridors and Wildlife need to move from one place to another I was going to crush your camera oh gosh look at spots so beautiful harness our defense i really hope to keep my feet dry on the trail today I really don't think that's going to happen it i think in all of its identity as a tourist destination as a place of amusement parks as a place of beaches the identity of the heart of florida really gets a lot of awesome but it's still it's still beating absolutely amazing to be here I don't think very many people know this place exists you don't have to go on a thousand-mile expedition to be a conservation for tarpon you can find a place that you love right in your own backyard go out photograph it share it tell its story and you'll be surprised the amount of change you can help create yeah

Larry Wilmore had a question for me he was he was like totally there too let's find out so let me ask you this mars is there a possibility that there could have been I don't mean microbial life but I mean actual intelligent like human life on Mars at one time I know done now I say yes now extinct now extinct I mean could mars have been inhabited for a variety of reasons maybe the atmosphere is different it's all broken down and out so I think about it off and put some people that life on Earth may have started on mars and yes yes literally writes coming over here ya go away micro thing coming across the planet here spawns there so here's an interesting thing about civilization on earth if all humans left Earth today you can ask how long would you have to wait for the wasn't a trace of our existence here you have to wait until the countenance abducted bringing entire cities with them into the lower levels of the earth's crust and in those zones is so hot everything Mills back and gets spewed out again what's the time frame for that millions of years millions of users not that loan watch mars' is not as geologically active as Earth now in now way way far back millions of views billions out so now you get into billions so I think it's unlikely unless we would have we would see settlements along the river banks that are now completely dry if why would you lose a city but still have the Droid riverbed that's there that does debt that doesn't play right if you gonna decide we were relating to its hear them yes white house can you do it in a lien city that evaporates when they're done with it I mean I don't know evaporating series self-destruct in school but not likely but not likely precisely

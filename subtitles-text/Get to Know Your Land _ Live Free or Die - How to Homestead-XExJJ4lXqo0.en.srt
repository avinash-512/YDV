hello there hello there hanging out in the forest garden being cool home standards so when I first came here I had this idea of looking at pictures and books of what my homestead was going to look like pictures that were taken and very different landscapes than Western North Carolina and sit well it looks this way in the book it should look this way here right and that's not at all the case the land already has momentum ok the land already has a direction that it's headed in right so you can learn what the land is up to by just looking and listening and smelling and tasting so when I showed up here as I was clearing I was noticing a lot of pine trees so from that I i figured that know that I can grow pine nuts there's also American Hazel's growing here which don't make too much food so we replace those with European Hazel's ok so if you intend on getting some land and growing some food don't have an idea of what the land is supposed to be doing look at what it is doing and just help it to do that better so ask what you can do to help the land out to do a better job of producing food instead of demanding that it does something for you that might help

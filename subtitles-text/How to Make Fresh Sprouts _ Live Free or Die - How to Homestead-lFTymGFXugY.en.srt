i would like to show you how to make fresh clover sprouts one of the things that tony and i have a hard time getting the winter are fresh vegetables one solution to that is to make sprouts here i have a whole bunch of clover seeds just take a couple tablespoons of sprouts and put them into a clean jar next thing I'm going to do is pour some water in and i'm just going to pour you know about a cup so that's enough to cover the seeds and swirl it around make sure all the seeds are down under the water I'm going to let this sit overnight that's going to start the germination process so after 12 hours i'm going to drain the water we have a screen and it fits right into a mason jar lid so I'm going to dump this out and you want to let it I'm going to find a spot to let it sit so a dark area is perfect and I don't want it to be too cold so i'm just going to set it on the counter here while the star is sitting it needs to be rinsed twice a day and that's really important because if you don't rinse it often enough the sprouts and the water will get kind of smelly and you will notice after a few days that the sprouts will start to make little tiny roots so this is another dr sprouts and these ones have been sprouting for about four or five days and you can see they've got roots and they also have some tiny light green leaves for me so once your sprouts are done sprouting you can put them in the fridge and that will stop the sprouting process in order to make sure that you don't get any bad bacteria in your sprouts you can spray them down with vinegar and then rinse them off my favorite way to eat them is to put them on salad and to make like a little salad dressing to put on top I'm gonna try to apply to them and very good I was a really fresh spring kind of flavor yeah

so I'm just wondering what mental process empowered him to make people laugh over things that might otherwise so my tragic topics was fined up how did you make because that's a secret recipe I don't know what that is how did you do that that few people who can do something doesn't make it a Edith trying to tell her neighbor in a bunker you know about her on all family trying to tell their neighbor that she may have breast cancer that she either may have breast now it's a very serious moment but we know either and we know she can say the word not because she has the problem but because breast is the word you people don't say in polite company immediate mine certainly not in the nineteen seventy well I would should be the same idiots today okay already in her bed but certainly not 1930 and a and the other woman who we know and though in the audience who gonna find out have had and has been through it and has no problem I there is no who married to be had there but there is amusement and claps and so and they and those labs are hardier and warmer because the audience is caring a great deal about the outcome yeah I hadn't got to think about it that way if you're invested in computer if you care then it's a different kinda laughter if it's just polarity right that's that's a it's a brilliant distinction there and we went for those kinda laughed the audience were involved in a serious problem with these people and when they were called on to our apt 5b other guys frustration and a a and fear sheer a it it made it more

I'd come to South Africa had launched myself into exploration and out I went looking to combine these technologies satellite imagery and handheld GPS started mapping sites i saw that cave sites formed in linear lines myself fossil sites cluster together and treat me so much i put together a list of targets print them on an a4 she loaded my dog into the car and on the first day out of 121 new cave sites became an addictive process by july that year 2008 I found more than 600 cave sites i discovered more than 60 new fossil sites and I thought this was my legacy is fantastic this will be my gift to future generations of these discoveries began in a situation that i found myself in back in the nineteen nineties the situation where exploration appeared to have been finished in the field paleoanthropology in the search for human origins I found my own University closing my exploration program i found myself in a situation of assisting in a job search to find a new director to push the paleoanthropology the human origin study in a new direction towards technology towards the application of using modern technology to study existing fossils not to find new ones a young man that was going to take over my directorship position and leaders in the new direction was killed in a motorcycle accident in London but we'd already invested in that direction we had a postdoctoral students computers everything and one of them a young Kenya named Jackie came into my office and said would I be his postdoctoral supervisor now with this tragedy and I said no because I can't be your a lab guy i will feel God and I just found this site it's bugging me if you want to learn to be a field guide let's go out to the site and see what has to offer august fifteenth 2008 job myself a dog towel my then nine-year-old son mathew you walked up to the side i got to the edge of it we're looking around I said go find fossils and with that off Matthew and towel win and I was talking to Joe and I said you know I don't know why they left this little hole miners it actually found this and just put a couple of blasts into it but then they left it and as I finish saying that Matthew who is now 15 yards off the site in the middle of grass says dad I found a fossil I almost didn't go and look but he's my nine-year-old son and I like all of you you want to encourage fossil hunting so I started walking towards him and this is what I saw and five meters away I knew his in my life we're going to change forever it's sticking out the side of that rock i saw a hominid clavicle Matthew says I cursed I don't remember that and i turn the rock over and they're sticking out the back of it was a John a tooth and that would lead to an extraordinary time Matthew had found a skeleton one of the rarest things you can ever find that skeleton would be part of this skull we would eventually find another one and then another one and then another one and then another one we would call that little site malapa and it would for a moment in history be one of if not the richest early hominid site on the continent of Africa skeletons in remarkable pristine condition the organic material I threw myself into this this was a paleoanthropologist cool equipment of winning the lottery we don't find these things over the years following that 2011 2012 2013 we would have the time of our scientific lives something like 15 papers in the journal Science more in the journal Nature dozens of peer-reviewed articles it was living a scientific dream it was our version of a scientific lottery all from a little site that looks like that a hole in the ground and i realized at that moment this is about june july of 2013 that I had made an error that error was pretty fundamental in pretty simple i had not been exploring since Matthew it said I'd literally won the lottery why would you fair enough to say that i was putting together this great scientific team we're producing this research but I had not gone back out and gone to those hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of sites that i discovered walking those hills and so I decided to go back out in the field but if you can imagine that this landscape is less than 45 minutes outside of the city of johannesburg looks like that and when you look at that you probably see one of these beautiful rolling African landscapes that's not what I see I see a giant block of swiss cheese because underneath that dolomitic limestone our network of hundreds of kilometers of caves but most of them are not these big cavernous type caves that some of you may envision when you hear the word cave most of them are these small narrow trenches ins and splits in the ground forming along ancient fault lines and I was thinking how am I going to do I had done cave exploration in this region back in the nineteen nineties and I had looked and squeeze my way through these things in the nineties and it not found much as I was thinking how i would move forward with a exploration program to take my surface images and move them underground a pirate walked into it was a former student of mine Pedro boshoff he had gone off diamond prospecting in central Africa and failed and it come back destitute and said I made a mistake I paleoanthropologist my love please can you give me a I want to get back into it and I said you know your timing is good I want to get underground and petrol quickly found out something that I already knew that like me he had no longer become physiologically appropriate for much of this underground work these are narrow squeezes but I said you know get out there and go to the areas we know the best I had learned something from allah and so he went to the caving club and found two young men who were physiologically appropriate on the right was Rick hunter who was a member of mensa who had been kicked out of high school for blowing up the high school science lab that is a true story and was working as a builder and on the left Steve Tucker an accountant by day we showed them what we were looking for kind of cast photographs and sent them into some of these deeper recesses Stephen Rick went into the site that they expected the least from perhaps the best known cave site in South Africa if not in Africa the rising star system it was completely mapped or so they thought until they work their way on that late evening up an area after spending four and a half hours going to torturous sort of little squeezes and crevices up a thing that's called dragon's back on the map a series of collapses it's knife-edge they were 40 meters underground they climbed about 20 meters to look down a little slot those seven and a half inches wide into the darkness and of course they went down down more than 60 feet into this narrow slot squeezing their way and not knowing if it was going to open up at any time and down you drop at the bottom entered a little narrow passage and there they began to immediately see small white bits on the ground that look like bones they followed them in which led to a slightly larger chamber and they are they saw a material on the ground they thought looked a lot like what I told them we were looking for october first 2013 i was sitting at home the front inner comment my gate went and picked up the intercom and their voice said you're gonna want to let us in it was creepy just like that there's petrol and I open the gate eventually and let them in Steve opened up his laptop and I saw the most extraordinary pictures I thought I would never see in my life yeah

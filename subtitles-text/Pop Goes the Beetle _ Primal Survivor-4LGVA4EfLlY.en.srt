dehydration is affecting my coordination I should drink but there's a problem with my remaining water this water in this bag has been here so long and it's been so hot it just tastes so rancid I'm thirsty but it's almost under incal drinking bad water will make me ill and vomiting or diarrhea and the resulting fluid loss could be a dessins so i need to purify what little liquid remains in an environment where water is scarce and sources often questionable boiling it is always the smartest course of action and the Berber nomads go further adding meant to make a tea with antibacterial properties that's a refreshing pick me up while the fire coals are still hot I'll cook the last of my food supplies these beetles you smell them in the emitter toxic noxious smell it's almost like creosote you're definitely gonna pack a punch when they're done but roasting them a little bit makes them taste a lot better sorry buddy OMG that's for sure definitely popcorn with a little bit of gasoline but they're not that back kinda nice actually alright it was a very needed break

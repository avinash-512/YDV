what's this with escape artists I never was chanted by that is others have been when you try to escape artists you really talk about houdini and that a lot of knock-offs after houdini in the early 20th century a man born in budapest claimed to be born in Appleton Wisconsin which is about all you need to know that tells the whole story takes a straight jacket and says his tagline I defy the jails of the world to hold me early part of the 20th century and then hangs upside down in a straitjacket way up high literacy of people in Times Square many of whom are immigrants and this man self-made man by any definition you want casts off the chains of anything that any corporation or government put on him keep on this metaphorical that's his home isn't it and you know that was the idea of its time that was an idea of its time as important as Bob Dylan singing before Martin Luther King and I had not thought of it i mean it's really really very good and the other guys come along and said get the pick-ups balmy year ago but that's not what's going on there we celebrate houdini because he grabbed the heart of America in some ways he was the first modern stories the first celebrity to appear nearly nude in public he's the first celebrity to have descriptions of the show's be more important than his shows Sudanese in the dictionary you know to pull a Houdini me to disappear you become a verb and we walked out on the street right now if you walk out there and say to people named a magician and you asked 10 people at least one of them and maybe seven of them will need houdini pretty heavy you know it's a hundred years and that's because he was speaking for america's heart let me just say to yourself again I defy the somebody's have you

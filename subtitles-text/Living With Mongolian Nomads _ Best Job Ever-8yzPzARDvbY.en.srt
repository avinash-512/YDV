I'm in Mongolia to discover what it means to be a modern day no matter wrestling is traditional in Mongolia you know was it physically difficult yes was I scared yes did i lose i was slaughtered what made it special was at the end of that whole day I had this man speaking to me in Mongolia and sharing his philosophies of life you need to be able to ride on horseback to be a nomad children learn to do this literally in many cases before they even learned to walk I've never been on a horse in my life there was no instructions it was get on your horses and go in that moment it felt like there was no separation between myself the horse the earth the land the culture it all blended into one and i will remember that for the rest of my life mongolian life is extremely difficult but you don't hear a lot of completing I don't even think they would define it in those terms as hard or difficult it was just like I survived is a nomad for more than a month hope will definitely not which is the glimpse into their experience will help to dissolve the wall between yourself and others we can walk away feeling that this mongolian wrestlers mongolian Kurtzman or known that is just like us Marty and I set out on an expedition to make the first print and interactive maps of Patagonia national park to give people and on-the-ground perspective what it's like to stand in the park itself

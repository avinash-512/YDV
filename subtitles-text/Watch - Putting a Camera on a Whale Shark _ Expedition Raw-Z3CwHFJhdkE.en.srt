I'm out here putting critter cams on whale sharks and hope to better understand their behavior along the reef we spot a shark it was coming up to the boat and actually very curious I didn't really realize where the shark was soon as I jump in the water and jumping right in front of the thing I just see it the shark with its mouth open I can't get out of the way and so it precedes just to run me over and go on its merry way i'm working with Brad Norman he's a whale shark expert who's been studying the species for many years he really has it down on how to get these cameras on the Sharks the method we used to attach the critter cam to the whale shark it doesn't hurt the shark it doesn't put anything through the shark unlike other attachment method that actually will stab or poke through the front of the so at the end of the mission the camera will release from the dorsal fin of a shark and float to the surface and then it will send out a signal and then we'll go pick up the camera in the the coolest part was was getting to be so up close and personal with such a large ocean animal it really is a surreal experience so we're dropping this camera down to take a closer look at the rain came to kill one of the girls

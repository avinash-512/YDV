cleaning rivers being a young girl loving dinosaurs that little bit unusual and everyone thought I was kind of weird but you said get over that and just want to follow your passion is some great really I'm part of the research group which is based at the University of also we're searching for these marine reptile fossils in rocks that were deposited under water but through time have been lifted up being a paleontologist I realized that it's actually quite back-breaking sometimes the feeling of finding something is amazing just sort of turning over a rock and finding something underneath makes your heart need I'll of paleontology because there's always new scientific discoveries popping up all the time new dinosaurs new prehistoric animals there's always something new to discover and we know so little about the history in life when I tell people what I do there's a sort of complete silence till they process what does that mean and how could somebody actually have a job like that

most people think that voters are pros at ravaging carcasses but sometimes they have to sing a backdoor approach cultures often just aren't strong enough to break into the hide of an animal without larger scavengers to help them out cultures have to go for the softest part of the carcass first like the eyeballs and the button yeah that's happening more and more often wear things like hyenas and jackals are hunted by humans and there aren't any left to help the vultures get a carcass open so even if you don't care about protecting the larger scavengers let's do the vultures of solid so they don't have to go through the but  so one thing that really surprised me was from 1970 2010 you know in 40 years we've lost over half our wildlife populations

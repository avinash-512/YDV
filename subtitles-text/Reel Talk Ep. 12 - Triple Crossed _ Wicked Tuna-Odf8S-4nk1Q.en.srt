to know Real Talk I've just watched the newest episode a wicked tuna now it is time for wicked tuna Real Talk weekly web show were some Gloucester's best blue fin tuna captains join me to discuss the latest episode my name is Mike salt I'll be your host once again in the hot seat this week we've got captain Dave Herrera fishing vessel tonight dot com captain TJ on a Hot Tuna captain Paul Ebert up the kellyanne well off to talk about this week first and foremost on everybody's mind I'm sure is what happened between Dave and last week day was struggling to find patient teacher helped him out by put them on the spot where the Hot Tuna had just caught three fish so TJ of course expected Dave to let him know if the bite was on again and that's poppin Dave caught on the spot didn't exactly tell TJ let's see what happens any bites up that way said com Park are between a rock and a hard place got a fish on the deck right now TJ he put us on a fish but I can tell when the real because I by told TJ right now everybody's gonna know am one our choir danced on the same place here pretty quiet remarks them one like that sign up and that's it something else bring I waste time amazing while guy crazy getting definitely spectators that not too much going on up there though day very very slow %um TJ's at a spot right now that totally dead we got this year and we can take a manager at and surpassing I'll Michael R no I thanks to you by a day let's start here I mean a you know I think there's always two sides to every story and let's have you give us your side about what what happened here why would I want to tell him well fish or I wanna catch 3:10 ish and that's that's my goal I want to be on top I gotta be on top is a hard at all to hear some of those things said about you and we can about it would you do anything differently if you would do that again now the same thing to change the way you do business teacher in the not not with David in general sharing information now never I'm only got so for the fishery because my relationship people and because networking with people whether be from the Gulf remain down to Cape Cod and I don't want to be lied to so it's not gonna change my approach you know a mandate you shame on me if you burn me that's my problem but I'm not gonna change who I am never no way I didn't get the call I I hope they go up but he did woody did to protect himself it's protected and to gain a lead in and ultimately I can't really hate on for that you know is an thing that happened course but you know its competitor fishery we're competing against each other and I mean that's how the console that I he had a great meal at the group me anyone of us if we're on the meat by your mark in vision is on a boat site weslia harder than I mean that I could dream come true for to recovery tunable yet so I me i i have to be honestly I'd like to be in a position to win that more I fished when a guy that nobody liked but we were up like the hardest ball around for years we had so many enemies because we wouldn't tell our friends what we will catch in because people were at the doc everyone like hated us and call the sly is what we use to finally say is don't ask us no questions and we won't feel I ask tough questions I get no I'll write thats it comes down because when you tell one person that person tells their friend cuz they are obligated to tell a it when it comes down to it this is a very Cut Pro I said it from day down when this they were worth fifty cents a pound it was caught trout were makin 300 bucks a fresh and we've been kinda each other's don't lie to each other back in the day we can also big game torn-up everyone wants the biggest the most and now they're worth money like screw you were gonna family-owned support myself well all the Hot Tuna guys this week got pretty worked up they ended up confronting Dave and his crew we'll see what that looks like air people will see this could be interesting I don't think they've show any remorse I think he's gonna deny deny deny countries think what can I say to cover my ass scumbag we doin that have it yet parade epic fashion on by that to break your fingers by the mall could now a bomb you when I work together you know I talk to you guys on the radio I'll call log Here I am helping the guy try to put them on the me any basically just bit my face I can't trust the guy and all these people that tried to warn are left behind my back right now I look like a fool because nobody name is good but it's not me. and the mother lode showed up this guide he's wanted to other three years and people still hating West Island I have no idea I heard you guys on the radio if you just shut his mouth and fishing be right we're out here you home I'm are we good now you you really sucks what they did to us but we can't afford to dwell on anomaly where amount we just gotta get back up visions and try and salvage just read as good at it get there could be DJ Dave seems to think you're going to get over this and that you guys can continue to work together IMEI you know I wish I was deftly aggravated the moment did I miss out on sufficient yes but hey I take the high road man I mean he got me he got me whatever but it is what it is I i kno the other day a lotta guys give Dave a lot the fishery and they take on the names but you know what it's because he's successful resides i a produces the other day he catches a fish that's or twelve thousand dollars I'm not gonna lie is I don't wanna but i know if i was thinkin debut on the first guys there and and I firmly believe the house like we were just absolutely you have to mid-30s I is there a long memory with these things though in a in the fleet I had to put myself in the in his position is coming towards the end or all fight to get this top spot and I gotta be honest its it be a tough call to say I maybe on the same thing so competition aside meee you look there in and clearly its its you people are listening radio chatter you can't do what about a text message what about a cell phone cell phones no work can contact a call and we are sixty miles offshore and perhaps how impossible are the only thing they don't work and I we were sixty miles miles away yeah so there's no any is like variations event northwestern idk where out you might reach and I think that's what people don't necessarily understand aim is there for you to communicate with TJ in that situation the only way for you to do it is to do it on the radio to so %um no way of telling him without alerting everybody meaning get on the roof would 10 for oil on your home trying to smoke signals smoke signals happy to have a secret frequently used terms and now I can talk to larry is it does go in and out we and yeah if he does but open challenges reach me agreed twenty other boats listen rally a meme game all if it was me in your situation I would have filled the boat and went in and told them then but not on the radio you guys have talked a lot about how tough it is want every he shows up in the side officially in that moment you know I can understand his train of thought but it still sucked but you were all cut three times I mean I mean like advice I saw some go off next to me why these guys and I was aggravating the moment but you know it is what it is you have to just move forward and learn from it TJ you mention having a bulls eye in fact have a whole arsenal on Dave he's the guy on top so you're done for my it's it's tackle allowed the ball now I me he's when and everyone wants to take a mami everyone knows his family your Dave always gets hot and sometimes he just he walks away so it's it's our job to try you know get him and take him out your dad reacted pretty strongly to the he seemed pretty upset well why I was going up so yes I admit I've got you I freaked out everything happens for a man when are you you're hot you're your upset about but when I confronted a there on the war it you really I was someone over it I just kinda want to call now and make little bit alive it but and the other day I don't hate let's move past this and get over to the kellyanne the bad lock it did unfortunately continue this week paul your only hookup was a shock nice one tale health ins Wadala haha the I'll tool God love Bianca nope moron on 'em thank you photo/mark died while anything abt all garage God Shah seriously we can't help what bites the line but we really needed this one to be until now we have to get a few more fish does a real deal letting us out broadband think it's the real deal you're all pumped up and stop did not the anchor fine fine comes up in it another shot that so-called me it's getting to the end of the week someone caught a fish am worried just gotta go

gonna go are you gonna tell everybody where you're going are you gonna keep that a secret %uh you learn anything from this episode or not may go to let you know how you know II going to keep things on the cover for now I'm not sorry I you know damn well I'm not a not a lot of the information being shared I think after this although it's it's very tight competition between these guys and I've been struggling all year but I my focus is to keep them together keep the guys on the boat together so we can and not lose money on you will you always come on strong at the oh and I always did cuz I don't stop who I steady all the time no matter how many fish in Lausanne like I let's go get another one well nobody will ever question that no matter how bad things lock Paul's always got that attitude its

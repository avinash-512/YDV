When I'm really desperate for something salty  I’ll grab maybe a pickle or bag of potato chips, but macaws, they grab a big old hunk  of dirt. All animals need salt, badly, for basic biological function. Animals in the western Amazon are really deprived of salt because the Andes actually block the weather  from the Pacific. So that means that all of the weather comes from the Atlantic. By the  time that salty air gets all the way to the western Amazon, most of that salt has already  fallen. So animals in the western Amazon are really desperate for salt, and they'll go  to great lengths to get it. Macaws, in particular, which are specialized for fruit in the very  highest part of the canopy will come all the way down and they'll eat the dirt. They’re  selecting these very specific layers of soil that were formed over geological time during  periods where conditions were a little bit saltier than in the other times. It’s like  a vitamin, but it’s especially salty.

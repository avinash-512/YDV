when I was supposed to do with this I am a white kid from Brooklyn and I'd never been to an indian reservation with the boy this deliver the bike like this like the purpose of this buffalo hunt is to help feed a few families in the community the Bison were everything to the Lakota there's so much of a connection between what we are and what we eat and where we come from o.o men all hit me Oh men don't lose faith in me okay my personal reason for joining the team on this buffalo hunt what's to understand how one animal can be utilized to show that nothing goes to waste these tourneys right here right here in front of his ways isn't necessarily soon the group had me take the first shot and in case i missed a seasoned hunter was right next to me to take the backup kill shot it's critical once you wounded Buffalo that you actually kill it because it's very difficult for a wounded Buffalo to survive out in the wild ultimately Ranger Jamie big crow was the one who took the final kill shot the reason for butchering the Buffalo right there and then was because they needed to use every single part before it started rotting oh god oh god it's gonna smell good oh god it was very challenging for me to be sitting there with that knife but I knew it was something that I had to do and when you're walking in someone else's shoes you do your best not to ask questions but to just do so with an open heart go to the back of the bank its ultimate consequences are key there are no roads there's no axis peppers are defensive i think the most important thing about them is they are incredibly powerful

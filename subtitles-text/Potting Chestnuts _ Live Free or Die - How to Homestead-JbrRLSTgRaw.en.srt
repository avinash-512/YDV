today I'm going to show you how to move these germinating chestnut seeds to another location it's more conducive to growing them out to maturity this is optimum size for planting once they get this big they get to be kind of unruly but the only reason why I knew these were starting to germinate was because of these little boogie starting to pop up out of the out of the substrate let's go ahead and toss it in a pot here tap them in get a drink of water and repeat what you got your chestnut seedlings potted up in their pots keep them in a warm spot until the threat of last frost has passed we're keeping them on a rocket mass heater bench in our house and that will give them plenty heat and they'll grow up pretty well and adequate sunlight comes in here to keep them going somewhere maybe middle or late May we'll go ahead and put them outside the ground and they should be should be good to go should be able to take care of themselves after that they go ahead and find the chestnut forest and people will be reaping the benefits for generations to come

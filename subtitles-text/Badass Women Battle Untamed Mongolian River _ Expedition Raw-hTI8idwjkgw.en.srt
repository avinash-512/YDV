Badass Women Battle Untamed Mongolian River _ Expedition Raw ok very confusing using this map with new coordinates to try to figure out with we are in this complex channel madness same everything really and then I bahria we went to the far east to paddle parts of the armoire river that I'm river is the third-longest free flowing river that's left on our planet and with sixty percent of the world's rivers being damned now it was an opportunity to see something that's truly last of its kind oh oh god it's crazy and we traveled the whole length of the armor by many different means of transportation what I can't feel my legs can you feel like talking no no it also hurts what hurts so this expedition was comprised of four women I was the leader of the expedition was anybody else hear me there was Becca Dennis who is our River guru there's crystal right who is our expedition photographer and then labour party who was our River ecologist the amor was so unknown we could never tell how much risk we're actually in it was really unnerving we felt really small and really confused as to if we were within a level of risk that we were comfortable with it what's going on ever I'm really scared I'm sorry mom you're right it was a terrible idea we didn't realize it until the end of the trip to the Mongolians that we met over there they were making sure we are taking care of as we went along the whole trip it more than anything they brought a lot of lightness enjoy those really important to us not to take ourselves too seriously and I think there was something special about that dynamic being for women and being able to just be totally silly and rambunctious and be ourselves dancing was a really healing joyful part of the trip and there's something about dancing like moving your body rather than talking about something thinking about something that's challenging there was something of incredible about that for us you know there's some places that are as powerful as they are beautiful and the own on river was definitely one of those places for us what's happening internally how going out and pushing our comfort zones transforms us that's where the magic is for me

while it might be easy to recognize twins growing older predicting what their brains will do is not so simple to gain insight to the tween brain we're asking people on the boardwalk some questions about good and bad ideas is it a good idea to eat salad how about bugs with ice cream is it a good idea to go to the gym and work out I think eating ice cream with bugs on it is a horrible idea going to the gym is a good idea a good idea is Alan these questions might seem easy even obvious but it's not what you answer but how you answered that says a lot about what stage of life your brain might be at young children generally answered quickly based on rules they've learned from grown-ups what do you think about swimming in water where there might be some sharks grown-ups of course have learned these rules over a lifetime and also answer quickly as a terrible idea to swim in water with shocks I think it's a terrible idea and water you see sharks what do you want to be fish bait but things are different with the tween what do you think about maybe swimming with sharks they're not naturally going to like are you okay you are on the fence as well yeah it wouldn't be in to meet you they just speak your personal legacy he'll swimming with sharks seriously why aren't our tweens outright rejecting a bad idea we often criticized tweens for acting out of self-centeredness but these girls are doing something too much younger girls aren't we are exploring their options in the teen years in the very beginning of adolescent the world is yours the possibilities are infinite almost like another toddlerhood in terms of the explosion of independent thought they become super self-centered is the sort of idea right and the thing is if you look a little more closely it might look like they're being self centered on the surface yeah they're actually being hyper vigilant they're being aware of themselves in context considering the possibility night which is a really important part of learning about the world you have to consider yesterday surprising right what we think of as preteens being self-centered might actually be your early adolescent brain doing its due diligence making decisions not from selfishness but from taking the time to consider all of your options and everyone else's point of view

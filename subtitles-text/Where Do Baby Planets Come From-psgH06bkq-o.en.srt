what if we were born from the ashes of our dead parents creepy right the last house some planets could be born hi there are mean o Neill space producer for Discovery News and I wanted to address that kid question all parents tread where do babies come from well I don't have to answer questions on either parent or biologist but I can answer where baby planets come from planetary formation theories kind of a logical sense starting with the nebula containing hydrogen and dust a club may form inside the stellar nursery undergoes gravitational collapse our some was spawned inside such a cloud where in 4.6 billion years ago forcing a chain reaction of spark fusion creating a soda core while I n sun valley burned putting in more and more materials a bolt up a dusty disc became compressed spinning around the young stars axis of rotation as time went on this dis knows a protoplanetary disk cooled and small dust grains starts to clump together over hundreds of millions of years these dusty clubs became bigger and bigger exerting a growing gravitational pull attracting even more dust these clamps attached two more clubs forming small rocky objects called asteroids asteroids collided clumps and grew and eventually form proto planets otherwise known as baby planets these proto planets kept growing eventually settling into their current stable orbits in the solar systems planets so earth started out as a part of the spinning disk then a clump of dust been a bigger clump of rocks followed by proto planet and eventually the planets we know and love today this is all well and good in theory but it's been hard for astronomers to observe these processes around other stars but that was until the european southern observatory is at a common Large millimeter/submillimeter Array also known as armored spider protoplanetary disk surrounding a star called HL Tauri in 2014 at the time this image was called revolutionary by astronomers as it was the clearest view yet of the tracks or gaps carved out by baby plants around a very young star in 1 million years old but these gaps didn't necessarily prove that they were formed by unseen protoplanets it was only indirect evidence then gravitationally vacuuming up the dusty debris so there's a chance these track could of being just empty regions but if they aren't empty regions this with me to be the first evidence of a young star birthing baby planets now astronomers using the Very Large Array in New Mexico view the same star at longer wavelengths and is directly see material clumping inside one of these gaps and they've estimated this club composed of one centimeter white grains ways in it between three to eight times the mass of the Earth which gives us a hint about how big the future planet might be if it is indeed a planet that fuzzy blob is basically the gravitational agglomeration of small pebbles getting corral to form larger and larger clumps that would go on to form a planet and that ladies and gentlemen are where baby planets there is however some weirdness which is sometimes the case in astronomy in another study published earlier this month dying stars may also be able to give birth the planet yeah dying stars giving birth the planets kind of weird using the ESO Very Large Telescope interferometer or VLT I this is located in the Atacama Desert in Chile a dusty disc produced by a sun-like star was also image however this was no young star is a dying stars run out of fuel and puffed up into a red giant and a sporting a protoplanetary like disk yes it looks like even dying stars could produce baby plants like a young star cousins for more the cool science about why stuff in the universe is always spinning check out traces of space at the news video is the clouds of gas moved an undulated through the universe some of them were denser and some were thinner something perhaps a nearby supernova they think caused the gases to begin to coalesce and as the gravity of these particles increased they began to fall toward each other and to spin do you have any other awkward space questions you may need answers to let us know in the comments below and don't forget to like this video and subscribe for a new episode of dnews every day of the week

so let's go piece by piece one-way mission with people who would just we agree to go one way and he sends supplies in advance there's gonna set up have modules got an image of what his have modules would look like I'm on Mars I think we can put it up on the screen let's check it out man seems like a really fun place to live with people so it's like 2,000 square feet four feet before people i think about you know I guess a regular-sized house almost in the suburbs yeah yeah exactly okay forever forever right well until you build another one of those so I asked pass what are his plans for actually making this happen yeah let's check it out a very important benefit of the permanent settlement aspect is that the size of the of the hardware you need to land is only slightly bigger then associate such systems as the Curiosity rover so we are building on a on a payload mass of roughly 3,000 kilos of useful cargo to serve so excluding the the landing system itself 3,000 kilos s that's if that's a few people plus food and drink exactly and and the Curiosity rover was only nine artists kiitos but it was landing at about two kilometers altitude above the Martian 0 and we will be landing at about minus 4 to make sure that we have as much as possible benefit of the atmosphere as much as possible time to slow down ok so what you're saying is i didn't know this in fact that the elevation where they landed curiosity the the air the density of the air was relatively thin correct up compared with lower level lower areas since we go lower you can you can bring more stuff you have you can use more air to support your landing correct you have you lift as you descend detecting ok and therefore bring more stuff bring more stuff which is very important because every kilo you sent to Mars is very expensive so you can maximize what you can bring so finding a place in low elevation in the rights and latitude 44 shoulder and water so as far north as possible for what about as far south as pas small of course for the Sun you got you got Mars in your office and I don't know you're not getting this so so you're thinking of landing in a place not too close to the polls may be too cold and not enough sunlight correct a closer to the equator but not on the equator because you think there might not be were there or less yeah there's a lot of research going on that's at the moment and we think that's the best place is probably between 40 and 45 degrees north latitude and that's where New York City's we're 41 degrees north latitude so your day will be very comparable to the day in new york city by me

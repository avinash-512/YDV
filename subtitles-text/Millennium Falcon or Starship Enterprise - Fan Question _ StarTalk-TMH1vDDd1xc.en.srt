yeah it's easy oh my gosh no the enterprise there's no question no question the enterprise has the benefit of being real in the sense that they're real scientist and real engineers on staff on the ship monitoring its engines its warp drives its photon torpedoes and so it's fake real as opposed to the millennium falcon which is just fake fake it's just part of a fantasy story telling in Star Wars not only that the enterprise and I've thought long and hard about this and I think what I'm about to say is correct it is the first-ever spaceship represented in story talented that was not designed to go from one place to another it was only designed to explore think about that every movie every show that preceded that build it to go to a destination and they go there they get out and they pitch tent they're not completely living on the ship as an exploratory vehicle that was revolutionary in terms of what we would think space wooden should be about plus in a battle the enterprise which is wipe its ass with the Millennium Falcon I'm sorry can I say that on national geographic

all bees buzz but bumblebees are one of the very few types of these that actually take that buzzing sound and music like a secret weapon to get pollen in fact what the bumblebee is doing is sonication buzz pollination it's a technique that it's adapted to get pollen that other bees can't get certain flowers are specially adapted to keep their pollen high up in the flour and a bumblebee can actually reach that with his legs are with its tongue so what it needs to do is vibrate to get that pollen to fall down and how this works is they enhance their wings from their flight muscles and I break your muscles really really rapidly creating an angry that causes the pollen to fall down onto their bodies then they fly on to another flower and do the same thing that's a super power as far as I'm concerned for bumblebees you have a regulator your mouth you're wearing a mask so it's not coming in your nose you're not breathing it in yet you're smelling hydrogen sulfide and it's actually going through the pores in your skin

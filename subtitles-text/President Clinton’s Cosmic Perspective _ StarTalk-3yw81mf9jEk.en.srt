a question to build in my interview I asked him how science impacted his perspective during his time in the oval office checking you know the most valuable thing i had for perspective and politics in the White House was a moon rock I was gonna ask you about when we celebrated the 30th anniversary of the walk on the moon in 1999 NASA came in with a vacuum-packed you know glass-enclosed lone rock that was taken off the moon 1969 that it's since been carbon-dated at 3.6 billion years old so I asked the because i had supported the space program so strong and said may I just borrow that to leave you can have it back when i go i know it's not mine but I really but they didn't say no to that question now so when you see these the television coverage of the president meeting with a foreign leader or whatever in the Oval Office there's two chairs and then there's this two couches and there's always a table between the catch i put the moon rock on the tape and for the next two years when we'd have like Republicans and Democrats and more people on two sides of any issue and they start really really getting out of control lightweight you see that moon it's 3.6 billion years now we're all just passed through here and we don't have very much time so let's just calm down and figure out what the right thing to do is and it worked every single time somebody they look most everybody Norman perspective same with middle of your catering object that existed at a time they can hardly imagine and it just gave him that little bit of space in their mind and spirit to try to figure out okay let's go with this one more time and that's what we got to keep doing we just have to keep moseying around both out there and in here and you know if you just keep stumbling toward Jerusalem good things happen I mean I may be wrong about it that's what I think I just think you know that ended I'd give anything to be 20 again I'd give up having president & gamble on my chances in the future if i can live another 80 or 90 years see what's going to happen it just to see it just to see it it's amazing what's gonna happen

Seth I called you into my office yes I I gotta talk to you want me to help you clean up clean up the office i got it at some point I had to find you and talk to you about the science in family guy yeah yeah you just have to watch a few shows and it's in there it's in there deep when I was a kid I was you know I was i I was in a church choir went to Sunday school and I went to a regular school and you know my parents believed in exposing me to everything and letting me figure it out for myself and eventually I said well these guys are you know making these assertions and these guys are making these assertions but these guys are back it up with something these guys are offering evidence and so that seems a little more trustworthy and and so I was kind of drawn to 22 science because it seemed that if you were right there derived from your own curiosity yeah yeah interesting actually wasn't a great science student in school I think you know it's not that you don't have to be you just have to enjoy it yeah whether or not you're good at it and people try to equate the two but I don't think that's a prerequisite yeah it'sit's and then you know obviously discover the original cosmos and Carl Sagan and and and at the time you saw the original cosmos do you have any idea that you would one day be executive producer on the next cause post didn't didn't occur to me didn't curly but it was was not something that that never crossed my mind during the early flatulence humor with Peter Griffin you're not thinking i'm going to executive-produce cosmos one day yeah it at someone yeah so that's it for me so we created Family Guy which started as like a college project at rhode island school of design and also he's the creator Ted one into and many people don't otherwise know or it's hard for them to imagine that he was co-executive producer of Cosmos it's one facetime odyssey yes what Seth was saying there's just a perfect example of how we should approach life and knowledge in general fart jokes but artichokes are there is a scientific paper written by someone the University of Michigan that claims that farts make everything funnier well as less than $PERCENT of the time i was with you and by the way that's wrong ok then the dinner with some well good look Seth as he described in that understands the difference between scientific and non-scientific knowledge because he was exposed to it and he uses it all both the scientific part and the non-scientific artistic part it's the best way to live life

studying science changed me and it allows me to make contributions into the world and everyone regardless of their identity should have that right we cannot get to the best possible expiration whether it's on this planet or beyond if you don't have a totality of people in the room to contribute to the conversation I i'm going to be an astrophysicist now wasn't quite that loud and probably not that confident when I was sitting in the library at the twelve-year-old girl and I figured out what I wanted to be when I grew up I wanted to be an astrophysicist and with such an earth rending discovery the first thing I had to do was run back to base camp and tell everyone there so I birth I ran home burst in the door said mom I'm gonna be an astrophysicist when I grow up I'm so excited is one of the first times in life that I had compellingly connected my identity and my interest so i looked up at her and I waited with bated breath to see what she's gonna say she said ok let's do it then and we were off to the races that was one of the most critical moment in my life because she confirmed right in that moment with her unflinching unwavering support that who I was and what I wanted to be were perfectly compatible and that they were well within the realm of possibility and sure I've had role models since then like doctor may Jemison and dr. Beth brown both black women astronaut and astrophysicist but that first moment with my mom I'm sure what set me on the course from that moment to this now wasn't until much later that she told me that I when I ran and told her what I want to be that she had zero idea what a serpent has was or what they did wishing an event if anyone could do it I could and I'm so thankful for that moment now it's been roughly a couple decades and I did ultimately become an astrophysicist some very excited to report that so i'll tell you a little bit today about my research on blaze ours so Lazar's what are they super massive hyperactive black holes thats it at the center of galaxies i'm showing you here real data from the Hubble Space Telescope Ultra Deep Field everything you see here is a galaxy every single galaxy we now believe has a supermassive black hole at its core pretty much you know most of these black holes are going about the business of being black holes eating things doing the normal black hole things but there's a special class of them that's doing a little bit more these are called quasars they are gargantuan championship eaters in the black hole texana me their millions to billions the times of our own son and are taking on a thousand times more than the humdrum black holes like the ones at the center of our galaxy so they are bringing in tons and tons of material while the black hole itself is you can that nothing is escaping it what you see around it are the SOS signals the death gasps material as it's being pulled into that black hole beyond that some of these quasars have these Jets will talk about that second i have these gentlemen are injecting material out of a sudden out of near the central stores that are going roughly the speed of light these are really the championship most powerful sources in our universe i studied bleh bars which are blazing quasars so you take this quaver that's doing that that beefy we're building a story come along with me that would be the blazing quasars right so now you take this jet that's moving in 99.999% of the speed of light and you pointed at the earth got really quiet you pointed at the you should not be afraid though these are topological distances so we're not in any danger this is just a benefit of the observational positioning so we care about these because they're pointed ass so what you want to do is understand how these Jets work so i'm going to show you a video in just a second about how the blaze our system works how black hole pulls on material and then how we think it creates a jet now this is not real data this is Magic it's an artist's conception but I wanted you to see so you have a picture in your mind as we're going through this story so what you're going to see is a black hole with an accretion disk surrounding it that's how material falls onto a black hole then the jet shoots out material and we're going to zoom out of that will see that we're sitting in the middle of galaxies and the thing i want you to notice about that jet is that it's not continuous it's sort of gotten particles and material in it so the idea that thing we want to figure out is how does this jet work how do we understand nature's particle accelerator how do you get things moving that fast they start off moving relatively slow like water going down to string and then they start to speed up the speed that's the question so what we found in our group is that on some level and in some of these huge injections of material the technical term is actually blobs which i think is the coolest thing ever and if you can constrain the kind of things you can decide you can limit what kinds of things can actually be possible so that's the actual like research that I do but in doing it I realized that research is not done in a vacuum and that in fact it was sort of an oddity that I was the one doing the work so i started to think about that and and wonder how is it that we can make stem or science technology engineering and mathematics more inclusive when i started thinking about well how can I do this and who would i start with and I decided to start with those with intersectional identities that is identity to overlap so i chose to look into women of color who want to pursue stem degrees so i started an online web series which you can go and check out called vanguard conversations with women of color and stem we meet about once a month and we talked about all kinds of things it's a pretty informal place but the idea is to confirm and affirm identity and interest that there's no preferred combination of those two and that anyone could be anything they want so I host the show and it's a group of rotating panel so we have a bunch of women of color in all kinds of different fields from graduate all the way up to deans of colleges that tell us about their experience they tell us about their expertise and they give us advice about how to do this process even better in this way we're trying to form and submit community so that no one feels alone or other because of who they are and what they want to do we decided that there was so much interest that we wanted to do even more so not just meet once a month and have this conversation but really start to build community and will be important that community be virtual because we're spread so many places across the country and across the globe so now we built a team and we are planning to make vanguard stem the go-to premier destination for stem identity and women of color and stem so here's an example of some of our recent content is created and curated by one of color and stem so we get their vantage point you're welcome to join us come visit support anyway you want to engage but this is a safe space for us to investigate those things that come up in our minds this idea that interest and identity are related and can be in any combination is an important concept but i'm not saying this as by way of asking to join the club I'm saying it because we cannot exploration whether it's on this if we don't have the totality of to the conversation so if we want to get to our best possible successes are best possible discoveries then everyone has to be at the table so let's explore thank you

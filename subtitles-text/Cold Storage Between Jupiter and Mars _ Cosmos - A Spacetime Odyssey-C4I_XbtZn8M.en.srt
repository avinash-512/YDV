are there any mementos from when the earth was born object that could possibly tell us his true age I know a place with a gun used bricks and mortar left over from the creation of our solar system can be found it lies between the orbits of Jupiter and Mars here is the stuff of the newborn earth adrift in cold storage unchanged ever since that time a million or so years ago the large asteroid happened to jostle a much smaller one sending it on a new trajectory a collision course that ended one night some 50,000 years ago

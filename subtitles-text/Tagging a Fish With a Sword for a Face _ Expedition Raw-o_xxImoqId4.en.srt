hours and hours of boredom punctuated by the craziest stuff you'll ever see in your life eight-foot selfish stare me down and there's not a damn thing I would do if it wanted to swim at me at 60 I couldn't react i couldn't move I just be a fish kebab they are as big as pretty much every shark below great way to bill Fisher be incredibly hard by commercial fishing so Crittercam is important because it it fills a vital gap in the life history of these fish where the fish are feeding where these fish are possibly greeting but the reality is the only way you're going to stick a camera to these fish as we have to fish for the critter cam work is conducted alongside recreational billfish anglers I hop on board people that already going out fishing and tag along and they get to see the science firsthand as well as real in a big fish at that points were fighting the fish we want the fish to get tired because we need to grab it by the build with the camera on the side of the fish if he's struggling a little bit i'll grab his bill and swim with them just to get some oxygen and water filling over his skills they communicate through color changes in their skin so they can light up a series of stripes and their fins and their tail electric blue and they'll raise their dorsal fin which is their version of giving you the bird just stay away from the point

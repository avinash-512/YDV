cut up into manageable pieces to where I can thought-out really easily on the trail for the nugs I can take a big giant block in the trail and expect to be efficient so I gotta cut this up into small pieces for what I'm doing I need about 60 pounds and me feed my dogs on the trails dogs need warm Mills so you had to make it to her doesn't take you hours and days to prepare this out there so I'll package it up bags but this will do for all three is in that way I'll take a bag not putting in some hot water called out in the cooler so right when I get to the checkpoint where my dogs are going to Cancun rest I've got them already and prepared they need this red protein me to build muscle and they burn a lot of calories you can have these dogs waitin to get their food because then they won't recover correctly

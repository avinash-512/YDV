my goal with this project was to make five or ten really beautiful pictures essentially giving a voice to these animals a visualforce and it was this picture right here that I think gets out the essence of this migration she is on them yellowstone was created a hundred and forty-four years ago it was created originally to protect these incredible geological wonders The Geysers the canyons the waterfalls the hot springs but since then we've come to value Yellowstone just as much for its incredible ecology these large mammals in particular the Rome widely across the landscape there now virtually synonymous with the word Yellowstone but at the same time a look back at these ancient sites in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem suggest another important untold story and that's what we're here to talk to you about tonight this right here is a drawing of an elk made thousands of years ago by Native Americans at a site called legend rock south of the town of cody wyoming there's over 300 petroglyphs at this site and most of which are the who loved animals the pronghorn to help the deer the moves the sheep and some of the tribes didn't call it Yellowstone after the rocks they actually call that elk river after these hold animals they knew something that has taken us a long time to figure out and it's these animals that Arthur and I have been focusing on for about about a decade for me this journey started on the Great Plains in South Dakota where I grew up and it was those geese right there that really pick my interest in migration fast forward to my early twenties there's a pronghorn migration that had just been mapped there were over 400 pronghorn that removing about a hundred miles from the upper Green River Basin into Grand Teton National Park so of course i was interested in I've got on my computer and google it it's no problem horn I wanted to see what it look like well it hadn't been photographed so I thought you know wow this is this might be my chance to be a photographer release to act like a photographer and I applied for a grant so I could follow this migration make the first photographs of it and I was awarded three thousand bucks and I was set so so for two years I lived in the back of my pickup and my goal was to show the beauty of this migration show people what it look like what it was like to be a migrating animal I started to get some of the first photographs of pronghorn migration showing them in places where they can't see far they can't run fast this picture right here is from mid-january and they were stopped by deep snow and it was around this time that I'd realize that well if I'm there the pronghorn armed and I need to start using camera traps and it was a way for me to document it without disturbing them this migration corridor there's evidence they've been doing this for six thousand years then I had to figure out exactly the trails they were using you know down to a couple feet so that was that was backpacking hundreds of miles trying to figure out where i was going to put my camera traps so i spent most of my time you know putting cameras at river crossings in deep snow that type of thing this is a pronghorn book that didn't make it for me migration equals wildness and I think this photograph gets at that these animals of visual voice and over the course of those two years I've felt like I got that done and it was this picture right here that really open that up for me the shadow on the rock the passing storm that entire two years worth this single moment in time she is on the move and so during that two years was realizing that we are having an impact and this needs to be documented so the housing developments the fences that are associated with them they burn up energy every time they have to cross something like a fence and some of them don't make it this fence has been retrofitted since that picture was made this is a famous place called trappers . in 2008 and this is the most dangerous place along this pronghorn migration corridor there's over a hundred collisions every year is a dangerous place for both people and for wildlife but in in 2012 the Wyoming Department of Transportation completed the first prong horn wildlife overpass in this group of pronghorn right here is the first group to cross in 2012 you can see a hundred and twenty pronghorn and then you can see one mule deer right there that thinks it's a problem or and I'd like to think that i had some small part in in getting that done and that's really when I started to believe in the power of conservation photography and luckily out of the blue I get a call from horse lawyer who is a researcher was the first guy to study the pronghorn migration corridor in the late nineties and he called me up and said Joe I just made a discovery on these mule deer i collared a small group of mule deer he thought they were resident dear into a surprise they actually moved a hundred and fifty miles to the north essentially linking southern Wyoming to the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem this is an incredible discovery said why don't you come back and photograph it that was sure that and the thing I realized with these deer is that the pronghorn was just the tip of the iceberg there is so much more potential in this world of migration and of course it's longer than the pronghorn corridor so of course they're crossing highways over a hundred fences and some of them don't make it so during that whole time I kept hearing about this guy do an elk migration work and and studying elk and wolf interaction up and Cody I heard that even the game wardens in the Cody office were calling him the elk hippie and out of the blue he called me and he said a code you want to do a project on help migration and it brought us to right here ok so i'm sure most of you knows but doesn't take much and why I'm going to get called a hippie I had never seen a wolf or an when I started this work i actually took me a long time to admit that because you know showing up in Cody Wyoming and saying i'm here to help with your wolves and out but I never seen them not a good thing you tell them that after you get the job and so one of the things i learned is why these animals migrate and this is a very important thing why do they migrate is to get fresh green grass grass is hard to digest you want the fresh green stuff and it stays green longer up in the high mountains and so this is the only chart you will see in this entire talk but it's a very important one and what you're seeing on the bottom on the x axis is the number of days as animals are off of the peak green and so as you go to the left they get to be a batter and there's a lot of fat involved here we're going from ten percent all the way up to twenty percent body fat one of the first things you notice is if their resident and blue if they don't migrate they don't get his fat different migratory they get fat and so what is that fat mean it means cabs it means productivity this is what allows the wolf to recover in the Greater Yellowstone this is what sustains that creature allows us to sustain the court recovery of grizzly bears wildlife watching and tourism these migratory ungulates by sustaining all this are a huge part of that economy there is a enormous economy for the communities outside the Greater Yellowstone when these animals are out there of hunting whether it be for meat or four trophies and that feeds enormously it in tens and tens of millions of dollars annually into these so these migrations are really important and so these these barriers that Joe introduced you to like these fences these are things that constrain the ability of these animals to gain that fat and so that made me want to know about it my equivalent of wanting to google the program we're not finding pictures was wanting to see a map of it and there wasn't one that used the new technology and so my part of this work was to set about doing that and and so we want to show you the Cody heard and take you on that journey that we took to understand and document this this is a population about 6,000 elk winners an enormous groups out on the foothills and often on this private lands and these private lands are managed for many different uses as well as adjacent public lands and so there are some conflicts here for these wild life whether it be a risk of disease that they pose to livestock or developments like residential and energy developments that impact the habitats of these wintering animals so as we move from the ranches up into the mountains 12,000 feet peaks and these elk are going over the top of them so my job is to show what that looks like so here's one of our first flights actually this from a helicopter just showing how truly incredible that these elk are these Mountain Elk this is it 11,500 feet and you can see the lead cow in this group of 12 is trying to figure out where they took a wrong turn so right here in the middle there's a telc that just gives you an idea of the scale of some of the mountains that these elk are going on so my job is to get a camera within two feet of those elk so here we are going to walk on that same path and try to figure out where these trails really are as you can see in this video there's actually a cut in the rock that these elk of cut over the thousands of years they've been on this trail I work on these animals with these collars from a distance a lot of the time and one of the things i wanted to do just experienced the same migration myself and so that's what we did so showing these elk on his high mountain passes the only problem is there's a lot of bears on these high mountain passes as well so a lot of my work was repairing cameras that were pushed down and demolished by bear cubs like these guys so here's Arthur and I at that last spot out cap it's only a couple weeks old and then she shows up that's not a good thing but I mean with months of work and years of work on this project i started to get some some video footage that actually captured you know the numbers that these elk are moving in I mean this is hot these are hundreds of help moving over one past together this is almost 12,000 feet so as we move from the mountain passes down to the river crossing the South Fork of this show any River that place i spent a lot of time at this is a river that's raging with snow melt super cold water yeah so the next part of this migration the challenge is to get up into the high country where these Oaks been the summer and it's very distant and hard to get to and so you cannot do this without people who know this landscape intimately and have been in it since they were kids this is the place where the snow and the rain and the Sun come together to make the grass that feeds this creature and feeds all this abundance and so that's what we encounter and spend time with up and in that high country is this great big summering groups of ELQ what I set out to do in the course of this work was to create this map fuller picture of the elk migrations of the Greater Yellowstone and i want to show you the completed product from that effort all these herds making that movement from winter inches in outlying areas of the system up into the heart of it so what I see here is the veins and arteries of this landscape what you can imagine as you think of these animals moving in then back out year after year is the pulse of this landscape so for me as a photographer how do you show that pulse or that heartbeat of a system in a I found this spot early in 2014 this like 10-foot by 10-foot chunk of dirt I knew all the out cross through and I I worked hard in 2014 and went back in 2015 and was gifted with an amazing picture it in that one picture took 375 miles on horseback 240 days that that camera is out there and I got one split second this migration that calf is learning the migration for the first time I feel like this picture is worth this entire project for me

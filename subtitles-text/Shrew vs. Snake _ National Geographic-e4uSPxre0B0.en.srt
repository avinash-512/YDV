meet the hyperactive short-tailed shrew under stress the shrews heartbeats at thirteen hundred times per minute and the Shrew burns so much energy if it misses one meal it can die so it's under most of the time the shrews life is simple in this Virginia garden hunt for food for an hour sleep for an hour glands on the Shrew stomach give off a musky smell which means that a predator needs a pretty strong stomach to take one on the garter snake is up for it this is one of the great hunters in a backyard garden it taste the air with its time and picks up a whiff of the musky shrew the garter snake has steel trap jaws he's ready to tussle but the snake is the one without venom the short-tailed shrew on the other hand is the only North American mammal with a poisonous bike that's why the Shrew isn't shy about battle the Shrew goes right for the garter snakes neck yeah oh the snake is in big trouble its muscles go slack its breathing slows paralysis will soon set in if the Shrew left alone instead the Shrew makes a feast of its phone in a garden shed another shrew looks for a meal but they have terrible eyesight and their solitary animals so these two shrews aren't aware of each other until they bumble into each other and then this garden isn't big enough for the bonus this is not a fast motion effect this is a real-time battle between two hyperactive short tail shrews the winner gets the other's territory the loser probably ends up as lunch let's slow it down so you can see just how extreme this dance of death really it's this is just like professional WrestleMania even though both contestants have poisonous bites experts aren't sure shoes are immune from their own species venom battles like this can go on for over a half an hour who's going to emerge the victor look at that tiny bike lights i'll wait a minute it looks like it's going to be a draw each combatant retreats to its home hurt to lick its wounds and plan the next battle

tested utilizes ingredients that we tend to have a lot of so I want to teach you how to make custard all you need is milk eggs and honey and then you can add some flour or cornstarch and some vanilla ok alright let's just use up all this milk huh I wanted to go back just going to go ahead alright so while the milk hitting up i'm going to separate these eggs from the whites simple way to do this for fast and four the white  we separate now i have a whole bunch of egg yolk start beating these egg yolks I'm gonna beat these egg yolks until they're really well combined and then an important some honey just about what seems yeah and I'm gonna beat these together until they're super wealthy and go right to our milk boiled now what I'm going to do is actually add that to the to these egg yolks i'm going to slowly pour the milk into the alright so this is nice and hot now I'm gonna pour in just a little bit of vanilla and a little bit of cornstarch i'm going to put this back on the heat just to warm it up and then once you're part of milk and eggs and custard mixture starts to thicken a bit that means that it's done so i'm going to go ahead and pull it off the heat because it's ready you can eat it hot or you can get it super cold and in the cold custard however you like to to eat it is you know really everyone we kind of tend to eat the custard hot because we're too impatient to wait for it to cool down but you can call it down if you want and need it

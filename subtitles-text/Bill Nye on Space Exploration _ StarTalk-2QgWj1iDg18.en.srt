Bill Nye on Space Exploration _ StarTalk before the show where I normally like throw to bill lost somewhere in New York but I've got bill night by right here give us that gesture that would bring your clip up what's let's roll that tape I'm for decades we've explored the near reaches about our space we've flown vehicles like this up in the IC blackness just to see what's out there but missions like this are just a first step it's early in the twenty first century I hope in the next 100 years we will have explored under the icy crust Jupiter's moon Europa looking for signs of life the next 100 years will probably know whether there was or even is life on Mars if we were to discover life on another world it would change everybody's perception life on this one everybody's perception what it means to be a living being on a planet in space would change I hope in the coming decades we commit to explore farther and deeper into space so that people everywhere will know the cosmos in our place within it so that people everywhere on Earth share a vision about our place in space

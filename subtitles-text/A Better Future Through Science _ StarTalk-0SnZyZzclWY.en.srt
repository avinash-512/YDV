in science fiction is based on and imagination but right now as an observer of the human condition it looks to me that almost all over science fiction is apocalyptic it's about a future for humankind that kinda sucks on Star Trek it's not like that it's never like that and all the versions of Star Trek the future for humankind is optimistic they've solved all the problems of food clothing and shelter you know this all too through science not only that in the Star Trek future everybody gets along people from the cockpit a boss trillion from North Africa South Africa North Asia South Asia from Europe everybody gets one because they point out over and over again that we're more alike than we are different that we are all in this together question brace that happy Star Trek future I embrace the process of science for a better tomorrow for all of us  we can all through science dare I say it live long and prosper sorry

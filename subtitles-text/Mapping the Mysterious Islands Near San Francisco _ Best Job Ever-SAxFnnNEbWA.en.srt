Roz and I went out to the Farallones to capture conservation stories and map the refuge the Farallon National Wildlife Refuge is the largest seabird nesting colony in the lower 48 states and it's also an incredibly important breeding ground for marine mammals like seals and sea lions missing most people don't know that the Farallones even exist the islands are technically within the city limits of San Francisco rotten ir cartographers so we're really excited to make an interactive map to allow people to explore the islands from afar the Refuge is completely off-limits to the public Ross and I are working in collaboration with the US Fish and Wildlife Service and . blue conservation science the only folks who are out there are this team of scientists 365 days a year since the nineteen sixties there aren't that many places along the California coast where seabirds and three males can spend time without being disturbed by some sort of human presence and that's why we're here we're out here to capture the essence of this place so that we can bring it back to the mainland one of the most consistent comments that I get is how adorable teen strap penguins are but every time you get near them the very first thing that they do is project output

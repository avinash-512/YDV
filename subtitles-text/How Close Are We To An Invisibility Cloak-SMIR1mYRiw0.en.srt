ever wanted to be invisible well science is getting closer to making that fantasy or reality hey guys Julia here for dnews so invisibility cloak seem like the realm of fantasy but science is working on it we see things when light bounces off an object and reaches our eyes to make something invisible to our eyes researchers have to find ways to bend light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation around an object previous versions of an invisibility cloak were less of a cloak and looked more like a medical device one involved a series of lenses that bend light around an object you can find out more about that here in Amy's video but scalability proved to be an issue it couldn't cover large or irregularly shaped objects like a human body for example it was really limited to simple objects like a cylinder and only at specific viewing angles if you were to walk around the object it would be visible but in the two-year sentence other researchers have come up with their own versions of an a team of researchers at UC Berkeley came up with a metamaterial that super thin according to a paper published in the journal Science the thing cloak is only 80 nanometers thick made up of tiny gold antennas that make you think you're looking at a flat surface and set up a three-dimensional it's because this metal material changes the way light is scattered when we look at someone our brains work to interpret the way light is scattered by their face and body but the cloak disrupt the way light scatters so instead of seeing the person in front of us we would see a flat surface pretty clever huh one of the authors of the study told The Washington Post that each antenna is designed to react to the light and scattered back and it's so thin that it actually acts like a cloak by wrapping around the object is hiding the benefit of this material is that it can cloak irregularly shaped objects like the human body for example but don't get too excited so far the material can only cover an object about one square millimeter about the size of a grain of sand so that's very tiny and only at a very specific wavelengths of so while we're inching closer to a true invisibility cloak we've got some major hurdles to jump over first since we're playing with light waves embedding them and scattering them at will things start to get a little strange it does a weird time you whiny thing and reflecting and scattering light it actually delays light it delays the reflection so there's a lag effect where the image appear slower than the thing that it's reflecting like time is moving at two different rates so if you're walking by a cloaked invisible box a bird flying by would pass at normal speed but if it flew inside the box it would be a few seconds slower and most of the cloak so far have to stay still as soon as you move the illusion is broken you've heard of the Doppler fact that's where the sound of pitch changes as objects moves past you that's because of how the sound waves are emitted when an object is moving fast it changes the space between the waves those changing the pitch and according to a study Physical Review a a similar thing causes a fast-moving clothes object to appear visible basically the frequency of the light waves changes as an object moves which causes distortions in the image and as the object moves faster these changes get more noticeable which kind of defeats the purpose of a cloak in the first place the other issue with these kinds of invisibility close is that while it might make an object invisible if someone were inside of that object they couldn't see out but this paper also makes the case that these distortions when actually enable someone in the cloak to be able to see out so perhaps their solutions on the horizon for some of the tricky science behind invisibility cloaks for now I'm just gonna go read some fantasy books until science perfects it if you want an incredible behind-the-scenes look at the james webb space telescope make sure to check out discoveries brand-new documentary telescope the world premiere is this Saturday februari 20th and 9pm on the discovery channel will be watching - it's crazy to think about how technology is making fantasy a reality like scientists are already working on mind control to learn more about that check out this episode right here recently Chinese researchers introduce a prototype for a mine controlled car this particular technology uses an EEG or electroencephalogram made up of 16 sensors on a cat that reads electric signals from the brain alright guys so what kind of techne you want to see in the future invisibility cloaks mind let us know down in the comments below don't forget to hit those like and subscribe buttons and keep coming back to dnews so you don't miss a single episode yeah

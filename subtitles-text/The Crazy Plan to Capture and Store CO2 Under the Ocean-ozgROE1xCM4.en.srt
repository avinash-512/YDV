co2 is created by every living thing on the planet but also by burning fossil fuels which is causing global warming so what we just wrapped it all into the ocean that would work right howdy oxygenators trace here for dnews every breath you take you'll be exhale and co2 in fact each exhale contains a hundred times more co2 than was inhaled totaling about two pounds of co2 per day per person carbon dioxide is odorless colorless highly toxic and apparently tastes pungent in acidic because earth is a relatively closed system carbon never leaves it gets burned and then trapped and then breathe and then reused all over the planet all over again and again and again most of us probably connect co2 with breathing while we only release pounds per day industry releases tons and if we don't capture it the co2 will continue to exacerbate the greenhouse effect in 2014 we were projected to release 37 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide into the air which is more than the planet can absorb this is getting serious so scientists are working on ways to filter and trap this ubiquitous gas in the nineteen thirties researchers figured out if you bubble air through a solution of a derivative of ammonia calling a mean the co2 will be plucked out scrubbing the air clean we've since developed a bunch of other ways to capture it but in 2014 MIT developed a super efficient process using electrochemistry electricity plus chemistry it's awesome the researchers use these a means to pick up the co2 just like in the 1930s but they added a modern twist when you bubble polluted air through an amine solution these guys naturally want to cling to the co2 they loved it but then electricity throws copper ions into the mix and if you're in a mean copper ions are way more enticing than co2 so they dropped the toxic gas like a bad habit and pick up the copper at that point the lonely co2 floats out of the yay afterward the copper is pulled away from the a means to have to run through that process again and again and again I sort of feel bad little hard-working guys you know but back to the co2 so now that we filtered it then what well because industry faces such strict penalties for releasing co2 into the atmosphere they created carbon capture and storage technologies essentially most companies take that filtered co2 cool it until the gas becomes a liquid and then transported somewhere they can store it there are two major ways to do this one is pretty straightforward and the other one just seems crazy the straightforward one is called geologic carbon sequestration in the states the US Geological Survey has identified 36 different regions around the country where the co2 could be injected into porous areas of rock between three and 15,000 feet underground and hopefully there it will stay the second is the crazy one it's similar but it's oceanic carbon sequestration in liquid form co2 is actually denser than water so theoretically if we just pumped it under the ocean the water above it would hold it down like a big weighted blanket 2013 study and geophysical research letters look at the viability of pumping liquid co2 to the bottom of the ocean and determined it would form a lake of liquid yeah the lake the high-pressure cold world of the deep sea would then hold it in stasis for maybe a thousand years I know what you're thinking and yes both of these ideas have their dangers for example in geologic sequestration the pressure of the rock above should keep the co2 liquid and it should stay there should but if the co2 does find its way out of the rock global disaster and the undersea example the implications are also dangerous co2 is toxic remember so it could drastically increase ocean acidity and deep sea life might not survive plus if it did leak out global catastrophe again look there's no real permanent solution to co2 problems except you know maybe venting it into space somehow are simply stopping the release of so much carbon pollution doesn't just hurt the planet though it can also hurt you check out this video to find out how smoke is caused by little particles that float around in lots of particles wind up at the airport all sorts of reasons from house does to dust for roads and sidewalks to exhaustively cars and power plants it affects the body because many of the particles are tiny and can accumulate in your lungs and if you're down to listen to my weird voice some more make sure you subscribe to my podcast on each episode we take about 45 minutes to dig into a topic just like here on dnews but all the way through it all the way to the brass tacks here's a taste by analyzing boron embedded in limestone from the permian-triassic period researchers found an abrupt shift in ocean pH levels mph is a measure of acid versus base and life can only exist with a nice balance every time we talk about this stuff i just kinda like never want to use fossil fuels again what do you think you ever feel guilty about your carbon footprint tell me about it down in the comments please subscribe so you get more dnews from us every single day and thanks for watching

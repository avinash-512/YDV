we got a whole slew of crap lying around our property and we happen to have a treadmill that we could probably Salvage the motor from and use it for generator was not we do it I'm taking this thing apart it was crazy i love taking motors need to eat electricity to spin and and turn stuff and then if you physically turn the motor backwards with wind power hand power water power it creates electricity to recharge the battery on their truck Tony and Amelia's wind turbine needs to crank out nearly 15 volts of electricity enough to power more than 160 wat light bulbs but working the next step in this jigsaw puzzle would be the shaft let's go search through our junk piles in our property yeah we're looking around under the house and we find a few different sizes a PVC that can be kind of put together now we're talking with PVC and then we found a long metal rod to connect our motor to our turbine cool look at how we use make the blade component of the turbine should do it next step is to build the turbine that's the part that actually is being spun by the wind so we need to find something we can use to make the blades of the turbine uh-huh this and we end up finding snow shovels oh nice I might have a design in my brain we're gonna see how badass of adjunct wizard I am gonna crank it up a notch got it wow that my masterpiece that freaked out contraption that's from the future i think the cool thing about found materials is there free but sometimes they're the wrong dimension little discombobulated you gotta get pretty creative to figure out how to get all the found materials to work with one another as a tight one we're ready to install it so the next step is to get this big crazy wind turbine up on top of the tower that's going to be a little bit dangerous but take a look for it

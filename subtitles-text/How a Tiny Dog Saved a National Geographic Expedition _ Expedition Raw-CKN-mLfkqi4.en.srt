meet scuba this little gal might not look like a bloodhound but she helped out National Geographic in a huge way my name is Alan Torchic and I build cameras for National Geographic and my job takes me all over the world deploying these camera systems probably one of the losses devastating losses of the camera was with the system that we call the drift can we spent about a year developing these two cameras we took them to Miami to deploy them for the first time in the ocean we went out in the middle of this crazy storm and put them into the water went below the surface when they came back to the surface they were caught in one of the fastest ocean currents on earth and basically they were just ripped out to sea and taken further than what was safe for us to follow them and at that point they they were lost so how does this little gal become our hero so it's three years later and we've just been contacted by this french guy who is sailing across the Atlantic and he's found one of our cameras literally in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean we're talking thousands and thousands of miles away from where we originally employed them within a very good day more win and the made-up began to Bach and we saw this ball who was lighting with a certain so we decide to to change your way and to approach it we saw it was for over electrics we thought it was it completely in the children come around but we know we were not sure and we saw his weight was a coming from nationality records getting the camera back was incredible i mean it survive for three years floating on the ocean which note says pretty good things about the design in general but not only that there was footage on the camera and that can actually be used for research our scientist dr. Neil Hammerschlag he's going to review this footage to get an understanding of the organisms that live at those depths in the ocean it's not every day a dog sea legs is the help National Geographic study the oceans I can't think of a better ending to this story not only did we find a puppy but we found arguably one of the cutest puppies in the world you did a bandit

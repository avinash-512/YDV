I've always got a lot more to do than I have time do not necessarily just work that has to be done the things i want to see things i want to learn about yeah didn't find any caribou out there but I was lucky enough to get a porcupine of eating muskrats of eat squirrels but i'm going to eat a rodent there's nothing better than a porcupine because of this five that's hard to come by a lot of animals out here really lean but this porcupine as you can see he's got a good layer of fat on fat has more calories than protein or carbohydrates and you need a lot of calories stay warm takes energy that's why porcupine is a special food for me out here look at that I got front like I got a back leg and plenty of that to go with that knee that's some home for dinner tonight porcupine everybody has to decide how they want to live where they want to get this close that's just what I choose to do it because I enjoy it enjoy living out here enjoy the lifestyle feel more connected to my surroundings I don't think this is for everybody but I think unfortunately there are a lot of people aren't doing what they love to do and that's too bad let life go by not do what you really want to do if you really want to do something to get out and do it this is what I want to do so this is what I did I bet it's just about done oh yeah that looks delicious look at that porcupine em that's not good look at that full moon tonight to eat out right mostly moves and then caribou comes next but once a while I come across something like a porcupine get a little variety that porcupine site is good stuff hmm that's the best part right there it is a little spruce see he's been feeding on spruce bark lately connect me the forest around here it tastes a little bit like the area

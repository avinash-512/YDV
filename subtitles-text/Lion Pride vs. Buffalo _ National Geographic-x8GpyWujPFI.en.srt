life this year on the mala mala game reserve in south africa is hard harder than usual a drought has left the animals here desperate for water and food this lion pride has had no substantial kills in months and several other Cubs have died the cape buffalo to have suffered grasses that should be in abundance have all but disappeared lions are one of the few animals who will challenge a cape buffalo Cape Buffalo's are large animals adult stand over four feet high and can be over seven feet long and weigh around 1,500 pounds and they're known to be ferocious perfectly able to kill an adult line but the Lions are desperate and so the pride takes a chance they stopped the herd looking for one member Varner Allah enough to attack for cape buffalo there is safety in numbers becoming separated and isolated is a grim situation the Lions locate their intended target this cow is large her sharp horns and whose could normally deliver a deadly blow to an unwary Linus but this Buffalo is old and slightly lame the Lions will exploit these weaknesses the herd has abandoned the count and the pride circles around her waiting for the right moment the lioness is attacked piling onto the Buffalo biting and clients from all direction yeah finally a male line locks onto the Buffaloes throat crushing her windpipe it will be a slow agonizing death it's a gruesome sight but the Lions fuzzy as well this kill means a renewed chance at life for them

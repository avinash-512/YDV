no one can imagine anybody else playing that role but you so what were you doing what's your secret come up if I love the whole concept of scientists who deal with are insoluble problems another story of some as noted scientist who's trying to find the solution to some problem and just didn't call me work on for months and 11 days not thinking about anything to get on the bus and it comes to you know and Doc Brown is trying to figure out how to how to do a time travel and he falls down the bathroom but his head against the sink and he suddenly envisions the flux capacitor and that's why i love that kind of connection because it's kind of the way it works well so it's just that basically the eureka effect yeah get hit in the head or something happens to abruptly and then the idea pops in but i'm a fan of the way isaac asimov interprets the eureka effect which is which is go ahead okay you ready the most exciting phrase to hear in science the one that heralds the most discoveries ok is not Eureka but rather that's funny that will that make sense yeah so meet you do you agree with this yes I had exactly that moment I first was working on string theory the nineteen sixties and consisted of hundreds of random formulas that he had to memorize in a book but Einstein wanted an equation 1 inch long that would allow him to quote read the mind of God and I said to myself hmm that's funny how come this theory has so many random equation there should be this one each equation one day I found it is called string field theory that's my equation i'm the co-founder of string field theory and it summarises the theory beyond Einstein in one inch long way but what was that a Eureka moment or did you just sort of it was as funny moment that it that no one was looking for it no one was looking for this one-inch equation right because people were so busy memorizing and using all these little hundreds of little formula that would memorize no one was looking for that one is equation

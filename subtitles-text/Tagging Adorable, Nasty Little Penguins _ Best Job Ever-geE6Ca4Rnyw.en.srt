yeah one of the most consistent comments that I get is how adorable and strap penguins are but every time you get near them the very first thing that they do is protect our food there int Anchoress they tend to be very aggressive and just eat the food out of each other for seemingly no reason right now we're putting radio tags on the Penguins to track when the Penguins go out to find food and when they come back so if it's taking them a very long time it means the conditions out there are not very good and that type of information can help set Marshall fishing limits and keep ecosystem healthy for all of these animals once we're finished we'll take them back to their colony and they'll be released and totally free to go back to eating their neighbors or pooping of things but as much as I complain about them any day that I am out working with penguins is a really really wonderful day to be able to make sure that they're all healthy and happy first you pups are too honey but they are ferocious in their own right

if I had a time machine I think I go back to when a mars-sized protoplanet sideswiped earth in the early solar system sideswiping our crust casting billions of tons of rock into orbit around the Earth which then coalesced to form our Moon i want i want to be around when that happen by the way back then the moon would have formed much much closer to the earth so the moon had been huge in the sky raising really high tides just that whole episode I want to bear witness to it did who doesn't love a good collision especially if a collision an explosion creates something explosions and collisions that are portrayed in the media today that something is always destroyed but this is one thing that actually created something beautiful our Moon now if i were to go back in time to when humans still existed i would go back i chilled with Isaac Newton yeah just to tell him how significant his discoveries were in establishing what we now take for granted as modern civilization the Industrial Revolution he was the first person to really put on the page the fact that the universe is knowable oh my gosh the universe is knowable that means we can figure it out manipulate it adjusted do things with the universe that are in the service of our curiosities we use Isaac Newton's laws to get to the moon is laws of motion and his laws of gravity I would tell him this I think he he'd want to know that

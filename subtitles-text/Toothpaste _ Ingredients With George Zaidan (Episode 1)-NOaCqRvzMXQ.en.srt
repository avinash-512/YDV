what's in here what does it do and can i make it from scratch it's the stuff inside your stuff ingredients toothpaste as we know it is relatively new only behind 50 years old toothpaste as we don't know it with things like rock salt pumice crushed eggshells crushed bone and even crushed oyster shells this kind of toothpaste is a lot older 5,000 years old some people say others say only 2,500 now the weird thing is old toothpaste and modern toothpaste not all that different we have and titanium dioxide now that is kind of a long list but we can split it up into different categories first and foremost are the abrasives abrasives are things like sandpaper or steel wool or Thomas abrasives literally scrape food and other gunk like plaque off your teeth now I'm not gonna lie when I discovered there were abrasives in a toothpaste I was surprised if you live a good long life you will spend 2000 hours more or less brushing your teeth imagine sandpapering a bone for 2,000 hours you would end up with nothing but powder but your teeth are actually harder than bone and iron and steel now different manufacturers use different abrasives in their toothpaste but they all make up a good chunk of the final product anywhere between thirty to sixty percent now the abrasive in this toothpaste is hydrated silica which believe it or not is the very same thing you find in these packets in your luggage and vitamin bottles except with water added now if you ever take toothpaste and rub it between two fingers what you'll find is that it's not that rough and that's for a really simple reason it's because your gums are a lot more fragile than your teeth so you don't overdo it on the roughness of the second category is called humectants humectant is something that helps retain water and that is what gives toothpaste it's and this is a direct quote from this manufacturers customer service rep smooth and carimi texture anyway the humectants in here are glycerin sorbitol and pro lean glycol and two of those molecules actually have an additional function they are sweet and they're not as sweet as sugar though so most manufacturers add some sort of artificial sweetener on top would be something like saccharine in here or xylitol in here now none of those artificial sweeteners break down to form acids like sugar does so that's why they don't cause cavities and you can use them in toothpaste and then of course there are flavors which are there to make the toothpaste taste not awful in your mouth feel clean now in our case and almost every case you will find flavorings super precisely described as flavor so that manufacturers can't steal each other's corporate secrets okay so we got abrasives humectants sweeteners and flavorings next up filming ages just like you find in soap or shampoo except here there's just one sodium lauryl sulfate sls as it's called in the business thumbs up real nice when you brush real some people say that all this foam trap some of the gunk that the abrasive scrape off your teeth that's chemically not unreasonable but I think the reason that most modern toothpaste have all those foaming agents is because you really feel good making the phone like you're doing something you are cleaning your teeth now you can actually buy non foaming toothpaste if you want ok so the next category is thickeners and binders which keep your toothpaste from becoming a running watery disgusting mess or separating out like natural peanut butter so the ones that we have in this toothpaste are cellulose gum and carriage and which come from trees and red seaweed respectively ok so we are finally at the last three ingredients please don't really fit into categories right so first there's sodium fluoride which is in almost every toothpaste manufactured today and prevents cavities next up is sodium hydroxide which pumps the ph up you don't really want to be brushing your teeth with acid finally there's titanium dioxide which makes your toothpaste white without it would be like a dull gray and no one wants that so now that we figured out what's in toothpaste and how it works I'm gonna try and make my own from scratch using only natural ingredients first I need a massive my bracelet has to not dissolve in water because it dissolves in water then it's no longer a solid and can't rub stuff off my teeth and I'm gonna use something that you can find in rocks all over nature calcium carbonate otherwise known as chalk and because i don't want my toothpaste to taste horrible i'm going to use xylitol as a sweetener and peppermint oil as a flavoring I've also got glycerin this is my humectants going to keep everything nice and moist and all three of these they come from plants I'm not gonna bother with sodium fluoride because i'm not going to use this to face for the rest of my life and I'm also not gonna bother with sodium lauryl sulfate the foaming agent because i really care of this foams up don't let's just do this see what happens yeah okay here we go I guess I just that's about right right here we how bad it tastes cum tastes like vaguely rocky toothpaste is honestly what it tastes like there's there's a little bit of peppermint there's some sweetness and then it tastes like Earth not like dirt but like like minerals not bad i would give this a solid seven out of ten i mean i'll probably never use it again but seven out of ten nonetheless if you guys have ideas on how to improve the recipe or if you have an idea for an episode let me know in the comments or hit me up on Twitter until then

a few years ago I had this big epiphany how do we shift from just something we're building together to all of these ways that we could be exploring together we're building the largest ocean observation network in the world and we're doing it with other people and powered by citizens and start my story for years ago I met this amazing person named Eric Stackpole he told me this wonderful story about this underwater cave that was filled with gold supposedly and he told this whole story of treasure hunters we tried to find it and then he showed me this little underwater robot that he was trying to build to explore it's called an ROV a remotely operated vehicle and how it works is it goes down underneath the surface it's got a camera send live video of a thin tether to the operator on the surface you can see what it's saying and drive it I was captivated by Eric story we didn't have any money to buy one of these RVs ourselves and unfortunately we also didn't know how to build one ourselves we had an early prototype but it didn't work so we did what anybody would do in our position we asked the internet for help we created a website called open RV calm and we started asking people to critique our designs and help us improve it at first it was just me and eric asking questions to each other about Plan C and and basic engineering and slowly people began to add feedback and give us advice I think they just took pity on us but eventually we got to the point where the robot was good enough to take to the cave so we got our friends together we mounted a little expedition and we sent the robot into the back of the cave and went down we found millions of dollars of cold actually we didn't we didn't find anything but we learned a lot and that was the important thing and one of the important things we learned was that this low-cost underwater robot kit was something that other people wanted and so we decided to put it on kickstarter and we raised a hundred thousand this was back in $MONTH 2012 when that was a lot of money on kickstarter and it was certainly more than we expected and it caused us to really quickly outgrow our garage operation i remember the day when the boxes showed up and I was thinking oh my gosh but we got them together and we got him shipped out and over the past three years we've shipped thousands of these things to every corner of the globe they've gone to the bottom of the earth in Antarctica they've gone to the top of the earth i got this photo last week from explorer who is studying glacial lakes in the Himalayas he's our schools in oakland our communities in Papua New Guinea we have people who are discovering glass bunch reefs in British Columbia we have people who are creating 3d visualizations of habitat for curbing monk seals in the community just continues to surprise us this was from last week we were up at Lake Tahoe we found a shipwreck a hundred and twenty meters and we're streaming it all live to facebook and Ustream and twitch TV was pretty exciting moment for us last week our latest design is the Trident so we took all the things that we've learned over the past three years and we put that into a new design for underwater robots that we think is a revolutionary step forward for low-cost underwater drones this thing is fast it flies like a fighter jet but it's also super maneuverable and still cost less than fifteen hundred dollars so other people wanted this too and so we raised 810,000 for this on Kickstarter last October and we're preparing to ship it in the fall of this year so we're really excited about that i think this is pretty amazing in just a few years two guys in a garage but turned into a global community of ocean explorers we're building the it's powered by citizens this is laura james she was one of the first people to notice that see stars were dying around the Puget Sound and she notified scientists and they confirmed that was part of this widespread die off it was going on around the Pacific coast called sea star wasting syndrome they didn't know what's causing it and Laura was not content with that answer so she started a citizen science project to get people to notice and contribute data that data was then part of the Pyrenees work at UC Santa Cruz and they did this amazing PBS story about Laura and her citizen science project and all the people that are contributing and a congressman saw that and decided to introduce the emergency marine disease act and so there's this bill in Congress right now you can call and help push it along but i love this story because this is it you know this isn't just a headline that see stars are dying this is people who are getting involved is Congress people who are taking notice and action is happening Lauren her team are still out there now they're monitoring stormwater runoff to see if that's the problem they're looking at merchants to see if the virus is spreading its the scientific method actually becomes the message there's this whole architecture for participation that's a big deal so I don't want to go into the details of what's going on in Flint it's an ongoing disaster and all of you know about it but i do want to point out that that too was a professor Mark Edwards at Virginia Tech was sick of the institutional failure so he gave out 300 kids to the communities that you guys need to start testing your water and take action and the Dead was a fantastic piece and wired my favorite paragraph was towards the end said this kind of citizen power apocalypse averting science is spreading he went to list a whole host of citizen science projects were doing similar work at the end of that paragraph i love this line i'm going to read it researchers are learning that there's a difference between publishing results and actually you know getting and so that's where we are that's what's going on the tools are getting really good really fast all of the microcontrollers and sensors and cameras and GPS are now building blocks that makers can use and all of these maker spaces are popping up all over the world and classrooms and museums and libraries and just in neighborhoods its profound and people have access to powerful digital fabrication tools like laser cutters and 3d printers it would be impossible for Eric to do what we did just five years ago we were really at the very beginning of this this is our same garage this is a our roommates at the time and they had this idea to create low-cost satellites using the same components and so they prototype the satellite in the garage and they've since started a company raised hundreds of millions of dollars and launched a constellation of hundreds of satellites they're not getting an image of every location on Earth every day it's a big company and they're doing important work this is an illegal gold mining operation in Peru that they find encroaching on this river it's really extraordinary I mean this used to be the stuff of nation states and now it's our roommates starting this new it's extraordinary this is not just a silicon valley store either these are DIY drones being used in Indonesia for conservation 50 cent microscopes tens of thousands of people are exploring the micro cosmos creating DIY Geiger counters to monitor the radiation after Fukushima there's all sorts of low-cost DIY bio equipment they're being used to power garage labs and community bio labs across the world the list goes on and on we need everyone to see themselves as explorers we need everybody to recognize that they have the agency to be curious to ask questions because I promise you when you give people the tools to ask questions they will surprise you with what they ask and with what they discover thank you we're in the northern part of the Red Sea and the reason we're here is we're trying to test out our swishy robot fingers for the for the first time in a real

I was seeing six blue whales in an area the size of a soccer pitch I've got to name the unorthodox wheels because they actually break the stereotypes we had for these species it is set me on an incredible adventure was back in $MONTH 2003 i was working in a whale research vessel that was circumnavigating the globe on this particular day of significance i was standing up on deck straining my eyes looking out for this part of sperms that we trapped all night long I could hear that sounds emanating from the pilothouse below me but I just couldn't see them I knew what I was looking for this shot lofty blue slide it off to the left-hand side super characteristic of sperm well I searched and I looked for hours and end and I couldn't find them but then I saw this at all powerful vertical blue that rose all the way to the sky as far as I could tell this animal is at least two kilometers away from us but it was an incredible sight and I knew he could only come from an animal it was incredibly large and powerful so I got super excited as you would as well and I grabbed my walkie-talkie to call down to my captain I said Bob eleven o'clock two kilometers gogo and he says why and I said I think it's a blue wheel and he said sure gets off course that's cruising the direction that I have now sent him off in and i am now like so afraid and paranoid to lose this visual my eyes are streaming as i stand to the glare I'm trying so hard to just focus and that's when I think I started to lose my mind because it wasn't just one blue and I was seeing I was seeing six blue I'm thinking to myself why on earth with an animal the largest that is ever on the plant with the freedom to cut like travel seventy percent of our planet choose to just aggregating this tiny little spot in a warm tropical ocean so I was fresh out of undergrad and I started to think about what I've been taught that may take six and what my professors had said and I remembered large rails like blue whales and take long-range migrations between cold feeding areas and warm breeding and carving areas that was it I was super stoked I was going to be the first person on the planet to document blue whales having six so I you know I thought this is also my career's made fame and fortune but people complain about this is so easy gosh so I'm they're eating the captain on him like Bob we have to go this is going to be so we're moving forward getting their work moving as fast as this but can take us and we get there and is not what you think there's not a single whale penis insight i am super disappointed because these words are now lolling at the surface hanging out occasionally one will dive come back up and I'm like what the heck is going on my dreams that I had created for the last two kilometers of my life was completely shattered and I was like oh my god what am I going to do with my life but I insisted that we stay around and watched for a little because you know this is my first you will or six and that's when I saw this this ladies and gentlemen is a pile of blue whale poop what's most exciting about this is not just the stunning red color but the fact that there was pool which meant these animals were feeding somewhere close now remember what I told you the start blue whales and take bianca is five degrees above the equator as warm as tropical as it can get what the hick how the hell were they feeding in these waters they considered unproductive because they're warm this was my Eureka moment not everyone can say that their career started with the pilot but I'm pretty pleased to be able to do that the thing is this moment spiraled into me pioneering blue l research in the northern Indian Ocean i launched the first long-term study on this population of pretty much unknown blue wheels crazy but true and it has set me on an incredible adventure in the intervening years i have discovered that in fact these waters because of the enclosed nature of the northern Indian Ocean the situation of sri lanka southern course is extremely productive for that latitude I've gone to name the unorthodox this species they don't undertake long-range migrations they actually have a very limited range they hang out all year round in warm tropical waters of the northern Indian Ocean there's the smallest of the blue is that you find in the oceans they're called pygmy blue whales they go to 80 feet not a hundred they have a different acoustic dialect they also have different behaviors they lift their tail flukes up before a deep dive more often that anywhere else in the world so you'll see this about sixty percent of the time as anywhere else less than twenty percent of the time it's a photographer's dream destination blue as ever and the world a cost benefit us because they're very specific they feed on one single thing crew these guys feed on something different but the key thing here is that they have all these different behaviors and adaptations because they're living in a very confined space / very limited range and during the course of my work I've also met the oldest blue will in our population i took this photograph in 2011 on a documentary shoot and as soon as I saw the markings i thought to myself i have seen you before luckily not a lot of work had gone on before on these wheels in fact there's only one paper that existed in the history of our nation and that was done in 1984 and you can see and I've named it will in time but the point is this animals at least 27 years old and it's living in our waters but what's really cool about the sighting is that you can see where i saw the whaling 2011 was just less than 10 kilometers away from where it was cited in 1984 so we're getting a sense of sight fidelity how important this area is to these animals we know that feeding breathing and carving in a very confined space so the conservation problems they face are far more compounded right now my crusade is about saving these wheels from getting killed by ships the southern coast of sri lanka is one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world it's the main artery through the Indian Ocean everything from Singapore to Dubai cruise right through these waters here's some of the data we have the red lines showing you the stance ship traffic the black dots those are whale sightings look at the south coast there is a distinct overlap so sightings like this i totally unsurprising this is a whale that came wrapped on the ballot containership into the main port in sri lanka in colombo in 2012 12 days later we had another carcass floating at sea with a massive propeller gash the thing is evidence like this can be a little bit red because oftentimes the carcasses will sink get pushed off shore or the deteriorate so much that when they come onto Shore we can actually identify the cause of death but calculations show that for everyone we document at least ten have gone undocumented so it's not an isolated incident neither the numbers fall ninety percent of the vessels that cruise through our waters are actually bypassing my country they're not coming into port so if we can shift the shipping lanes 15 nautical miles offshore we can reduce the problems significantly and then that ten percent of very vessels that are actually coming into port well if they slow down a little it would make a difference I've done the science I've created all the awareness and now i'm pushing for policy change both at the level of sri lankan government but also inter-governmental because shipping lanes are slightly complex problem but my work is not just about saving wheels my work is about showing the talent of the developing world I believe that we get local scientist trained so they can start looking after their own waters using local solutions that is what creates sustainability and i invite all of you to join me on this audacious audacious journey to achieve this for the sake of the oceans and humanity thank you you'll come in you'll see the the whale rotates as it approaches the bottom it's rolling on its side and the camera twists actually so it's pointed downwards and you see these little sand lance fish swarming all over the bottom that's the pray that the whales going after

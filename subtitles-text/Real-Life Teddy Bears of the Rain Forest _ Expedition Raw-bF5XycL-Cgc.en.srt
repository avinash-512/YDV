looks like there it goes I always stop reading it that it catches my breath because it's so exciting to watch this animal leak so far really wonder if it's going to be safe and if it's going to land and if everything's going to be ok but lo and behold the tree kangaroo does this normally and it lands it's fine when we catch tree kangaroos the local hunters climb up and disturb the animal and treat anger is naturally to get away from a predator their last line of Defense's to leap down to the ground we call them the ghosts of the rainforest and so it's nearly impossible for us to walk through this forest and actually see the tree kangaroos cannot that i have been studying tree kangaroos for over 20 years and I have never been able to observe their behaviour in the trees because tree kangaroos are so elusive we started working with national Geographics Crittercam and that animal actually videotapes itself where it goes what it what behavior okay well you wanna get dressed up a tree kangaroos are endangered because of overhunting and then also a lot of their habitat has been destroyed ok mmm good paso we have worked hand-in-hand with the local landowners and hunters to create this conservation area which serves as a wildlife bank in which there are safe places for so right now we have our group of hunters who are out in the forest looking for another tree kangaroo for us to be able to put another critter cam on I am so incredibly elated this is amazing we just watched the first piece of the critter cam and it's way beyond my wildest imagination I it actually brought tears to my eyes one of the hunters and landowners he already pointed to the video and said oh my gosh that's one of the orchid species we've never known that species before now we can write that down as one of the animals food plants it is like having a window into their world and it's very exciting and we've only touched the beginning of what we can understand about tree kangaroos

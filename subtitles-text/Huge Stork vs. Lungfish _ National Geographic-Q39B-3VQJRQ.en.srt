some animals look like they're made up of spare parts from other animals now take the Shoebill stork for example it looks like it's Colin's powerful beak from a pelican its legs from a flamingo and its head from an eagle the Shoebill stork lives in the Great Lakes region of Africa and feeds on frogs baby crocodiles and oh yes the - bill is the scourge of the lungfish it can catch and crush a lungfish in one snatch and swallow as a human you might think the Shoebill stork looks well funny but just remember it's all relative to a Shoebill stork you might look like a thick legged small headed non beat loser

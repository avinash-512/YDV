in this life I need containers of all kinds and one of the biggest most frustrating things for me is mice getting in my stuff drives me crazy I really need a container that I can put the cattail fluff in that i use for my tinder bundles a friend of mine was trading a bunch of boards that she had grown and I was able to get a few from her boards are basically like primitive Tupperware so the board has this outer skin and then it also has a shell and the shell is pretty hard so when I scrape this skin off I'm actually making it so the shell will last a lot longer now I'm cutting the top off the gourds that can open it up and scrape out the seeds from the inside I'll be saving all the seeds and then plant my garden so there might be bored next year now i'm taking my pump drill and i'm creating a series of holes all the way around the rim of the board and what I'm going to do now is lace a rectangle of buckskin and then put a drawstring up here and then I'll pull that draw string tight and this will stay big wanting too hard on a little break and cord will actually crack come to the phone look at that there we go I need to buy something like to make for myself great

over one-third of Americans have had a one-night actually almost 60 percent had a one night stand but what's interesting about one night stand over 30 percent earned in a long-term partnerships at standard akcakale did brain circuitry for why so basically casual sex is not in the shower so drunk you don't remember it it's not cash waiting I had I S at X 10 X as people with the Afghan him this all the time am he he's in a marriage meant that began as a one night stand a lot of people have i mean as I say over 30 percent of people have had a one night stand turn in a long-term relationship let's find out what he's doing talks about one minute I think that happens a lot more often than we know because people who meet cause the 1i stan has such a stake right people they're sleazy meetings they don't tell their kids about it your parents met in rehab if your parents met on a sex club for a dungeon somewhere in they're not on the back seat of a 57 Chevy gonna tell you I actually wrote a series of columns in the long-term advice column  while then lenders was writing her she would wrote a column a buncha columns were she invited our readers to share their how they met stories and they're all these me cute stories I'd answer this boy the USO dance during the war and then we wrote letters to each other all through the war then we met up Brandon generation who are now yeah a lot but overall XO innocent all over stories and I was thinking about people I knew who were unsuccessful loving long-term relationships many which had really not innocent starts who met you have one night stands like Terry and I did who met in rehab who you know had a drunken three-way and then fell in love with the acts they gassed at the three way that the bird even third the spare and a spare and both circle stories you can tell your grandparents or your kids that never get out no so we have this distorted view love how a decent loving relationship must start and then people do this thing I act in Europe your you make such a important point there because if we give the view %uh love and romance that we want to be true and that's what percolates then we established culture social mores based on that so that if anyone is different from it you got social or X 22 X tragedy yeah it but it's actually not I think the most damaging aspect of this sort of cultural belief that no decent relationship can have a sleazy start because people will discount people as potential partners  that they had a sleazy a meeting with and they will say I you know I might date this person this might have been someone I would date but look at what they did I couldn't date this person we had a one night stand and no decent relationship can grow from a one night stand so I can take this person and nobody's relationships girl the time for one night stands

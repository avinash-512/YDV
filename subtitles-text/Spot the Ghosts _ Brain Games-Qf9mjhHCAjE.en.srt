we've hit in a number of camouflage people in the scenery around this ghost town get ready to watch a sequence of camera angles from around town how many hidden people can you spot thank you got them all did you see six you maybe saw this guy or this woman but there were probably some you didn't spot like this one or these two sure didn't make it easy just how powerful is camouflage as a survival tool take a look at the Zebras standing together in the field can you count how many zebras are there there are six zebras in a shot at the uniformity of their black and white stripes makes it tough to tell them apart right but how we're scene is just as important as how we see

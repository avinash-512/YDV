what I want to do today is show you how I dry my fruit when I have extra and then i'll show you some other things that I also like to dry the thinner you slice the apples faster they're going to dry if you don't slice them thin enough they'll take so long to dry that they could spoil for the option dry out once i get to the core here I just turn the apple and I just start slicing the other side drying is a really nice way to preserve fruit you can dry a lot of things blueberries we dry raspberries pairs mushrooms we also dried herbs herbs and flowers the flavor of dried fruit is just it's amazing because when you dry the fruit it concentrates the flavor when you want something sweet dried apple is perfect so now that i have these sliced i'm going to lay them out on this towel in the Sun drying in a really sunny spot I usually tend to just eat them as a snack you know if I'm wanting something sweet and i'm hungry i might just grab a few pieces as a snap there's some dried apples and just leave these here for a few hours and then I'll turn the Miller as you can see they are kind of crispy really good so next time you have some fruit on your counter that is about to go bad instead of throwing it away go cut it up and put it in the Sun and make yourself some dried fruit snacks

yeah I try to use insect repellents that are natural so my number-one ingredient is hard next is genuine old-fashioned turpentine that my friends is insect repellent there's a couple of things I might mix in with it but that's a secret so I think I'm pretty good shape if they get on me hopefully they leave and go to other buddies leave this dude alone man he's got it figured out there are 63 different species of mosquitoes in Georgia living in an open-air fishing deck just above the swamp it's frontiersman Colbert little protection from their nocturnal rad just hard to sleep with mosquitoes climbing all over your ears and in your eyes and up your nose the higher I get the less they bother me the treehouse is a place for me to stay when rivers flooded and it's a place for me to stay when mosquitoes get really bad that the ladder I didn't design that for everyday use it's hard to climb that ladder with your arm full of stuff so I've been playing these this image in my mind of building suspension bridge as a primary access point from this beam to materials it's time to build my suspension bridge it's a challenge it's a lot of work but i gotta protect myself from mosquitoes

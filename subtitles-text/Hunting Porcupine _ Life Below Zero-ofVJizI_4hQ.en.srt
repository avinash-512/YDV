yeah the porcupine track and went right up here it's not too far ahead this is a fresh track hello areas right there right in that tree porcupines when they're getting chased they like to take to the trees I can't shoot with this rifle this thing would make pork pie soup out of that porcupine this is for shooting big animals like caribou and moves I don't have a smaller going me today when I have to cut the tree he got a little higher you got to think about which way I want to drop that tree if he goes over into that there's a real good chance you'll get away under that brush there i won't be able to get to him so make sure you follow this way he'll be out in the open I got much better chance of catching i'll put a little notch and help guide this tree down the way I wanted to go there got the notch I'll direct the tree where I wanted to go it's going there else got support fine falls out of a tree and land on your head that's your head could look like full of coils porcupine a very good II want to taste your animals i have come a long way from home I'm not going to bring back whole I got a butcher right here and it's getting dark so I better get on it will start by skin in this porcupine get the skin off without getting equal to me and i'll be happy look at that that's hard to find out here a lot of animals out in this country are really know it's hard to get enough fat off the land a lot of times but porcupines are one good source of fat to be tasty head off you got the hide off then get in quilting me and I just got to get the guts out it's interesting how one thing leads to the next out here so often the case i'll head out thinking that I'm looking for one thing along the way I find something else can't be too choosy and i really like eating porcupine so I'm real happy even I didn't find any caribou today that's where it goes keeps life interesting time to get back to camp go home and cook up some

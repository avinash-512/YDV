this common dolphin that just happened to wash up on the beach where Noah gave me a call said paint instead of putting in the dumpster would you like to use this for your project it was the perfect opportunity we're going to try to better understand what happens in the deep ocean when a dolphin lays to rest prior to this no one has ever done time lapse on deep sea marine mammals hopefully these cameras are going to be able to tell the story of how this animal decomposes over time you have no idea if it was just going to sit there and bacteria was going to cover it or if a big shark was going to come the installation just went perfect we lower the frame down we were able to adjust the cameras we turn on the the Dropcam and I think we chose a really nice place for the sun kissed often it took us about six months or so to really see all the flesh disappear from the skeleton this dolphin became a whole ecosystem playground for lots of different animals everything from the smallest little bacteria up to larger crabs and eventually octopus and smaller to medium sized fish this was no easy task we know so little about the deep sea that it takes animals like this to better understand what is going on down there our idea was to get the very first video and photos ever of a crocodile's jaws closed around we got our very first attack on a very first .

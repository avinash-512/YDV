yeah i would say definitely the number one modern conveniences that really miss the most and then whenever I i can take advantage of it i do is a shower some of the things I miss about living in society is a hot this hot water and the showers and washing machines these things are very useful because there's a reason why people invented water heaters i'll be honest i miss having hot water and being able to just quickly and you know watch a big greasy pot with hot water hot shower is phenomenal I like every time I get out of shower my friends can attest to this i've been at their place you know and come in and you're traveling or something and i'll be in take a shower and i'll come out and I'm just completely you have a huge smile on my face and I always say that's a life changer yeah so what I have to do now is heat up a pot of water over the stove and then you know use that hot water to wash the dishes and so everything takes a little bit longer but again i have more time so I'm okay with the fact that things take longer but yeah sometimes I do wish i could just turn the oven on not worried about starting a fire and everything else yeah there's lots of ways I've been trying to think of ways to make a hot shower out here and i think i've got some that would be really slick because them yeah feels good and it's a maybe not is you know I feel really strong when I jump in the creek in the winter like that really like is like while I'm alive but there's a lot of ways feel alive and coming out of a hot this thing in shower is pretty good too

that world of political geography is not going away at the same time we are engaging in this topographical engineering these very robust and engineering systems by which we modified the planet to suit what we want you to do what are various economic and political activities are so this is a very different way of thinking about how we map and what we map and what matters most on the map conecto graphy connect ography I've already heard it pronounced thousand which ways but of course what I'm talking about is the fusion of connectivity and of geography and all of that connectivity revolution as i call it falls into three particular categories that I like in two three systems in the human body and what we have here is the world's highways and railways oil and gas pipelines electricity grids internet cables all of this infrastructure that is massively exponentially accelerated our ability to move people and goods and resources and knowledge and technology and ideas around the world and that revolution is in by many measurements are metrics really just getting underway they said we were just in the early phases of this incredible build out of global infrastructure by some estimates will start will spend not just the four trillion dollars per year on infrastructure that we spend today but rising two seven or eight trillion dollars in the coming years meanwhile military spending worldwide though it's rising in in quite a few geographies as an aggregate is relatively steady at around two trillion dollars so what happens when we build out all this infrastructure as this as these infrastructure sort of envelop and wrap around I believe that we we evolved beyond one of the most ancient adages and phrases that we all know geography is destiny instead we think of the arc of history as really taking us in a certain direction in that direction is more and more and more connectivity there's a terminus for for academia extra statecraft which that infrastructure is so real where are so many borders are considered artificial that it has an authority a gravity if you will and when countries build infrastructure like a highway or a railway or electricity grid something really basic you know that they share with each other it winds up being something that is almost a you know irrevocable bond it's obviously positive sum and the more of those that you have the less one thinks about not sovereignty as guiding their relations but this connectivity really shaping how they relate to each other and so that's the shift that's happening now from political geography being the most paramount feature of the map which is again the borders to the functional geography which is the infrastructure and the supply chains gradually what I believe what happens is what i call the global network civilization that eventually emerges from all of this infrastructure within that you still have empires you still have nations you have city-states you have all of these various actors but it all adds up to a sort of you know coexisting civilization the surgery growth triangle Singapore Malaysia and Indonesia are trying to optimize their space and what you have here is a case we have a country's Singapore which has very almost no land but a lot of capital country like Malaysia that has quite a bit of land and labour and some capital and Indonesia which has a lot of land and a lot of labor and very little so you take these three countries that are all very close to each other and they said starting in the 1970s nineteen eighties let's start to take singaporean money and Malaysian and Indonesian land and indonesian labor and put it on some islands that nominally belong to Indonesia and let's start building ships that are owned by singaporean companies but let's optimize our geography let's treat it like we are connected by one supply chain and that's what they started to do and you wouldn't know that there's one set of rules in one place and another because now people can increasingly move seamlessly around them and that's how places one by one gradually their neighbors shift transition from political geography functional geography but the supply chains are in fact the original world wide web and they are that system of transactions that gets any one thing to it - 11 thing from one place to any other place and in many cases in the global supply chain today we no longer really know where something is made and so I believe that you know the labels on everything from clothing to computers and should really be made everywhere if you look at where the design is done the manufacturing is done the the production the the marketing the distribution the insurance the repair of any given product it involves you know companies and subcontractors is over from all over the world there's only there's very little that is made exactly where where where the label says it is in fact and that's what happens when we get to the supply chain world so you can see it in the fact that trade now reaches every corner of the planet you can see it in the ways in which people in the financial industry are affected by the financial crisis of 2008 collapse of manufacturing as a result of the financial crisis Automobile Workers manufacturing workers around the world you know simultaneously lose their jobs you may not have noticed it because that may not be your circuit but people who work in that industry all over the world simultaneously such is the nature of that connectivity among explosion it is a very human thing because each and every one of us belongs to some kind of circuit and we move we gravitate towards the supply chain towards these circuits we want to be part of them and when the supply chain and when infrastructure doesn't come to you you go to it right and and that is that is why so many people today why that's why there's more migrants than ever in history today people are on the one of the ways in which you know economist or others would measure the extent of globalization as they would say well x and y number of people have crossed borders any given that's not the correct way to globalization in my view it's how many people are connected and to get connected you don't have to move across an international boundary most people will never leave the country they were born in but if you move to a city you have access to services you may work in a factory of a foreign company or connected in order to supply chains will have a mobile phone all of these things connected to the world even though you've never left the country so to me the rate of urbanization is the greatest measurement of the extent to which mankind is getting connected and of course we live in a rapidly rapidly urbanizing world now most of the world's population does live in in cities already part of this global network civilization part of this move from political the functional geography is that perhaps not surprisingly cities can be seen as more important in many ways than countries so what is on this map is every human being in the world you have the entire world's population here and you have you know that the population density as well and you have these are oval showing you the kind of outlines of where the largest most you know most populous megacity clusters are and in the large circles tell you what a what percentage or share of the national economy those cities represent so what you're seeing here is not only where mankind is concentrated but of course just how significant those particular clusters are where they wear with where they're located and so you're 30 or 40 of these represent a growing share of of the world economy and by the year twenty thirty most projections estimate they'll be about 50 mega city archipelagos and these really represent you know the preponderance share of the world economic activity so i put out of all of them up on one map here and again I ask the question you're trying to understand how the world works that are not a naive question I wonder which map tells you more this one or the conventional ones or maybe some mix of the two but certainly not one that ignores this because the map that ignores this is not actually capturing who we are where we are and what we do part of this story is a what I call pop up cities special economic zones and fifty years ago we had almost no special economic zones in the world geographies industrial parks that were set aside and designated primarily for the purpose of attracting foreign investment bringing in technology training workers boosting exports allowing countries and their labor force to rise up the value chain today we have four thousand such world today it is the most rapidly expanding type of city so this is a a very significant trend in the world today china has become an empire of such mega cities each of which has almost at the designated economic function in the global supply chain and you think that it's fascinating it's very very instructive in the shift from political to functional geography that the world's oldest continuous civilization with very diverse provincial and linguistic histories in many of it in it in his provinces would say that's all fine and good you can keep your dialects and as your culture and so on but we need to organize the country in a new way so that each of these mega city clusters as an internally viable economy so it is anywhere from twenty to a hundred million people so that has lots of services and transactions going on among people so it's not dependent just on exporting one kind of widget or product but at the same time each one is very connected to each other through high speed rail networks and highways and so forth and internationally to the global economy and this process of reorganizing the sort of the management of a country is something that we that we are starting to see around the world this is how I believe it should happen in the United States what I'm basically saying is that the 50 united states that we have are very very useful when you're trying to win an election when you're out there campaigning but it tells absolutely nothing about how to properly govern America's geography to be an economically competitive superpower right what we need is for these mega regions if you will that have certain common internal economic characteristics like agriculture or industry to be much more seamlessly connected to each other and to the outside world they need to be built around urban economies of their core and they need to be connected to each other through freight rail corridors high-speed rail networks and so forth so if you take this layering of the natural economic geography these big patches and the urban clusters that are in white that are going to be economic hubs and then the infrastructure that's how you would turn the united states of america into United city states of america that would be one that would be far more a far more efficient for more viable far more sensible and certainly far more competitive the optimistic note that i want to end on that I in the book on this idea that we are actually returning to a fairly ancient model we are a coastal urban network civilization write a world in which people are more interested in trade and commerce with each other than conquest and this is what i call the pox or banica write a piece among the cities in which if we think of the way cities you the world versus the way the countries of the world you know cities are interested in in in trade and connectivity whereas we think of countries being expand interested in in territorial aggrandizement and so the more we move into a world in which that mentality of Interior be'n connectivity and and sharing lessons with each trading with each other positive some relations the more peaceful ultimately the entire world system can be but you know the the punchline really is that if you want to have this world you actually have to build it and it starts with what we are doing today and what we do a lot more of which is investing first and foremost in connectivity connectivity for countries connectivity for and connectivity for people and with that I'll stop thank you so very much yeah

and the scientists we often go to some of the most extreme places on our planet to collect microbes bring them back understand what they're doing and how they work these types of organisms can actually brought in our search for life beyond Earth by knowing what microbes are capable of we can think about other places where this could become a little over a year ago I found myself camping on the side of an active volcano i was there is the chief scientist of an expedition that went to examine vanuatu's Martin crater and it was unlike any other camping experience I've ever had right outside your tent window there was constantly a plume of toxic sulfur dioxide you have to go with the respirator whenever you went outside there's also smart to wear long sleeves there are tiny microscopic basaltic needles that would fall down upon you and when the rain was water it was acid had a pH of about two despite all these hazards it actually turns out that microbes can survive in these places and we were there to figure out why we were there for this this is the creator it's about a kilometer across 500 meters deep and at the very bottom of it in this pit of roiling lava is the world's most active lava lake we needed to get samples from the very bottom to understand how microbes can survive so we descended down the cliff when it's close to the edge of the lava lake as we dared all around us lava was spewing sometimes going over the top of our heads raining down upon us it wasn't a great place to be for a very long time but we were there just long enough to get our critical samples this is a place where the earth is forming this is how rocks come to be they are formed by volcanoes and everywhere on the surface of the planet microbes inhabit these rocks we wanted to see how this started we collected samples that were 30 seconds old we saw them pop up they were glowing red they finally cooled off we picked him up and we got a full time series across days weeks months years across the island to figure out when microbes colonize these rocks what that means in terms of a longer-term succession of microbial community inside these rocks and how that influences elemental cycles on our planet so volcanoes are enormous planetary scale loud very obvious features but they actually create these tiny micro niches that allow for distinct forms of life to exist and as the Geo biologist my interest is in these interfaces it's kind of where these planetary scale processes meet on the microscale places like this have been found all over the world and microbes typically find a way to survive their organisms in the Rio Tinto in southwestern Spain that can breathe metal and create these civic pools of blood red water the minerals that are formed here are actually found on Mars as well recently off the coast of Japan two and half kilometers deep below the surface of the ocean there are methane-producing microbes this is a whole different class of organisms are the insurance terrestrials living inside our planet and the lower temperature limit of life is still completely unknown microbes can survive inside ice down to negative 20 degrees Celsius and probably even cooler and combine these forces really come together to operate our planet we're on microbial world let's all just get used to it these microbes create more than half of the oxygen that we breathe they mobilize the nutrients that supports any sort of macroscopic life and on my quest to understand what the limits of this biology is I typically focus on the deep-sea we can think of the earth as a battery in the subsurface in those liquids and those gases those chemicals are said to be reduced their a lot of electrons on the very thin rind of the planet that we operate in the atmosphere the surfaceworld the ocean that said to be oxidized so where these places meet this pole and these these boundaries of battery that's where energy can be harvested so the deep sea is our best opportunity to find new types of metabolism and they're sort of three canonical categories over the last few decades that have been carved out within this deep-sea realm black smoker hydrothermal vents are precipitating these metal sulfides several hundred degrees Celsius the lost city hydrothermal system forms from water rock interactions no magma needed and this creates an alkaline system that leads to a whole different type of of microbes and methane seeps these are places typically wear one tectonic plate is subducted beneath another one in the organic do that had kind of fallen down on that first plate is being broken down and streaming up through the Earth's surface so these methods sleep so I've done most of my work you can see the methane bubbles coming out not as exciting as like smoke events on TV perhaps but more important because they're able to turn that methane into Rock might be the most important thermo regulators on the planet methane is a strict extremely strong greenhouse gas so by soaking it up into this rock we can do a lot of good they're kind of those three main flavors of deep-sea chemosynthetic oasis that i described but we're already sensing that there are other flavors as well recently in the mid came in trough the deepest and hottest hydrothermal vent had ever been discovered off the coast of Antarctica this carpet of Yeti crabs was found around hydrothermal vents these crabs harvest bacteria on their gills and eat those it's the microbes though that are making the food in the first place from the chemist chemicals and events nonetheless most of the deep sea looks like this to us we have no idea what's going on that's because less than 0.01 percent of the deep sea has ever been seen by human eyes this is the equivalent of Lewis and Clark setting out on their journey 1804 they leave their fort on the banks of the Missouri River they walk about a half mile to their canoes but instead of getting in those canoes exploring the rest of the continent seeing bison in yellowstone and Catherine new cultures seeing the Rockies seeing a whole nother ocean they spend the rest of their lives walking about half mile and studying that so why do we really care about microbes what does it mean to expand the realm of metabolic possibility from a very practical perspective we can do a lot of good the project I'm working on right now is taking these deep-sea methane eating metabolism and trying to import it into e coli through genetic means to turn methane into a biofuel the drugs and bio technologies of the future will most likely come from the deep sea or from the massive realm of untapped genetic potential in microbes around the world by understanding the vast realm of possibility of microbiology were also expanding the realm of potentially habitable worlds beyond our planet so other calculations that that our team had worked on showed that the method eating metabolism we see in the deep sea would have actually been energetically possible on Mars in the ancient past when there was water but to me most fundamentally this search is really getting to the center of what life is all about what is this crazy magical process that moves electrons around and ends up creating these self-sustaining self-replicating cells and ultimately leads to civilization and culture there's so much more to get to and we're really just starting this journey I can't wait to see what we find thank you yeah

you know there are no vehicles are getting customers right now and we don't go for a ride says astronauts we we I mean I helped design the cockpit in the shower head so you're trained as an engineer yeah I have an engineering background and I mean I help change how we operate the so use even as as the pilot of a Russian Soyuz I help change some operations and so is we we r intrinsically involved with making space light safe and so go to marcia conceptually it's easy to say yeah sure I'd love to get the orbit I can prop why I'm there just got forty percent faster our way but but I want I would want to be really involved with the vehicles and and making sure that we are reasonable shot I wanna die in a way to mars but I would love the opportunity to be part of that explore Moammar the course will be a very long journey with the engines we have now yes certainly and if it's a sort over free energy transfer was a nine months or something there I think that way to line up again earth and monitor the markets are gonna go that way so this this these are years here and so week you need many guitars in many homes on anything any cans of tuna I really we'll with my prediction we will never go to mars with the engine technology we have it's like trying to set up airline flights to Australia in also I'm thinking we just we don't have the technology to make it safe enough that we can ever do it we need we need to go from propellers two jets we need to go from strength wings to to metal wings we gets we're going to invent a bunch of stuff first and there's no rush to go to mars there's no there's no urgency the earth is a concern but it's not horribly threatened that we have to abandon it I think it's going to be incremental from station that'll be it that's a thirty year project from station to the moon that's probably a fifty year project and then a visual International Space Station yeah and then eventually to March but there there's no big rush this is just natural I nynex rush why not saw but because the trouble is if you if you make it a race then as soon as the first person crosses the finish then you don't you're done it's not it's not it's not how we explore to the right thing to do I'm you on that

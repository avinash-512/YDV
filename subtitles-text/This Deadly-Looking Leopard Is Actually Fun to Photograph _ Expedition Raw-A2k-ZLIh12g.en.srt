what are you thinkin I'm thinking that the Leopards really have me to kill told look at what i get to do yeah I get to work with big cats in the wild but most the time cats like your house cat you know what is your house cat to exactly what it wants to do and you just hoping for that incredible moment of play between the Cubs the tenderness between mom and cub and it's just a waiting game close we are there's one other cups over there you get kinda nervous because she looks right out batchi winches 10 feet away you don't know what you're but I work with rose that know these animals and they let me know what is saved and what is unsafe and we spend sometimes all day with them from dawn to does majesty of these animals when you see them in the wild when they're free and come face-to-face with the leopard edge just an incredible feeling that never gets old

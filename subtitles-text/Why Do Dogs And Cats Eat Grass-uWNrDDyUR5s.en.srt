sometimes I'm walking my societally acceptable pet and he just stops and eats grass why would a cat and or a dog do something like that hey there poaceae pet party people trace and Amy here for dnews grazing is a word you'd normally associate with herbivores like goats or cows or horses but if given the chance cats and dogs they'll graze do which is weird because their predatory carnivores right well not entirely though the felis catus at and Canis familiaris dogs are both under the order carnivora some believe they're actually omnivorous a study in the journal of nutrition looked at the diet of these two domestic pets and found that their ancient natural diets are actually relatively difficult to determine because they've been living under our proverbial wing for so long but they do have preferred diets which you can see in feral populations for example cats like they're hunting ancestors will tend to eat a number of small meals throughout the day mostly meets they learn their diet from their mother well kidding especially before weaning dogs are also influenced by their mothers diet choices before weaning but dog feeding behavior is more diverse simply because they've been human bread for so long generally though feral dogs will scavenge rather than hunt and domestic dogs can eat large meals relatively quickly probably a holdover from pack competition but if left to their own devices both of these animals will eat grass cats will do so likely as a digestive aid they need the fiber if the cat ate something they need to flush out of their system they'll not on some grasses to help it come up or go down stuff like bones feathers or just hairballs I actually do buy fancy grasses for my cat Pete and he definitely doesn't it you can probably see pictures of that honor yeah yeah a lot of them dogs on the other hand again are a bit more complicated veterinarians don't exactly know why dogs eat grass but their basic explanation paired with a shrug is likely the same to aid digestion perhaps dogs to need fiber in their diet to help the get things moving one thing is clear dogs do not eat grass in order to purposefully vomit right according to one 2008 study and applied animal behavior science seventy-nine percent of dogs eat grass and very few are ill at the time or will vomit after they found quote grass-eating appears to be a normal behavior and associated with illness vomiting or dietary deficiency so if they're not missing nutrients are fixing our own then why do they do it no idea more research is needed the wolf ancestor of a dog and a slip that is very similar to a jackal which naturally eats plants or fruit when they can't get their normal prey and on top of that grass eating has been observed in wolves and other wild dogs some think maybe dogs just like to taste as silly as it sounds there is a reason people might think this both cats and dogs modify their diet based on their experiences they get bored eating the same thing called the monotony effect and grasses have a Swedish flavor to human test subjects so while cats don't have a sweet receptor dogs do perhaps dogs eat grass because they just want a little sweetness in their life we might forget because of the way we subjugate the grass plant but grass is actually a tasty treat turns out grazing in the grass is gasps baby can you dig it I can dig it and so can pets look they might eat grass but they also eat their own poop talk about dogs dogs eat a lot of weird stuff which is why maybe you should keep their tongues away from your face right maybe not julian has the answer to whether or not you should write here there's a myth out there the dogs mouths are cleaner than human's this is not true both humans and dogs mouths both contain bacteria and lots of it but there's really no way to directly compare because while they are both males they're completely different environments are there any other weird animal behaviors we should look into for you we're happy to debug more myths tell us in the comments and take a second and subscribe here on YouTube and while you're at it check out test-tube plus it's a podcast show where we get super deep into a topic every week and this week we're talking about very appropriately animal domestication any did you know researchers think that dogs were the first domesticated animals they did not know seriously you would know if you were watching test-tube plus when it comes out we talk about stuff like this all the time and we're talking about how animals were subjected to do our whims Amy whims webs right

today I'm going to show you how to make a caveman zip time and you don't need to came in to do it yeah so this material right here is about as strong as a real zip tie it might even be stronger because right now I don't have a zip tie and if you don't have it you can't use it but I've got the Palmetto fiber this plant has a really tough outer material and I really brittle inner material so what I'm doing is I'm simply separating the outer material from the internet here wow that's strong common thing you need to do when you're in the woods with some kind of a craft project for the shelter is tied two sticks together so I'm going to look that around there the best thing to hold this together is not duct tape it's friction and always have a pocket full of friction with me it's one thing that you can always depend on in the woods is fine and friction there you have it that's what i call a caveman zip-top

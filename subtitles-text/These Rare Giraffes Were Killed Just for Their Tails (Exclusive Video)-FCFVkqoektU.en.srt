seeing these drafts from the air was really exciting seeing them anywhere is exciting because there's so few of them left but this was my first shot and there's a giraffe standing in this small clearing by a small tree and then the next thing i know there's three the next morning i was informed that about 12 hours after we had seen these drafts there's a range of patrol in the area that heard 10 gunshots it was too late for them to follow the shots to find out where they were they wait until the next morning they want the direction of the shots and lo and behold they found three dead draft in the area that we had been ok here's one conquer yeah that was horrible it was horrible for them it was horrible for me and the team and the crushing realization that its its most likely it was these guys these ones that we've seen and now there's three less now there's 37 it was really awful i was working in a very remote iconic national park called Garamba National Park dramas a park that is run by the ICC and the Congolese government in association with African parks an organization that's responsible for the management of the park in the wire life it's a very challenging environment on the Congolese in Sudan border the first thing you have to do is secure the perimeter this is the front lines of the poaching crisis with a terrorist network and highly militarized forces surrounding us in every this is a tough environment how high this glass is patrolling these grounds you're always at risk of an ambush when you approach these animals through the tall grass even though you can't see them yet you know you're getting close to the carcasses because of the sound of the Flies just--that's grow and grow and grow button at the Civil waste tomasa pussy catastrophic scale is best for people are conditional de la romana vs in Micronesia offensive scale on a dormir Dominicans another killer custody 04 me call the 787 says here the program visit tomorrow an awful lot to tell you one of these your country sadly in my career I've seen elephants before had multiple stages of decay but I've never seen a giraffe who kills giraffe you know it was awful because of their size and their explicit form they take a particularly grotesque appearance when they're lying down contorted on the ground this is a bull and walk over to that caucus it's a lot smaller cultures can see what that is that might be a female this is a tragedy of epic proportions for this species Kordofan giraffe and unique subspecies these are the last ones left in the entire region sad bought this is a female every single female that blues is a breeding female that can produce more on further examination there's also some things you notice immediately which is they didn't take any of the meat all that they did take is the tale we can now clearly see what what happened I think they'll probably all shot at the same time the first one in the brain the other one dropped right next to the first one and this one was shot multiple times as was running away you can see some shots next to the spine on the lift and some shots from behind under the tail this giraffe carcass is only 36 hours old what happened here was the approaches to Siri somebody cut this open with a not-so approaches cut this open to give access to the vultures so that the bulges can finish this carcass within two days and we contradict the the carcass from the vultures the longer the ball just stay around the longer we have you detected this one was was the one that was collared this was a draft that had a satellite cholera that was crashing for the African parks and around the team that was with us because this is critical data that they've now lost just our normal and approaching strategy is obviously not working this trough moves product we've got colors on all of our giraffe groups to know where these groups are at all times so that we can follow them we can't shadow them and we can protect them and we still failing you've got five groups of purchase coming year and identified helicopters we've got guys coming from the north there are a few are only after elephant they need to fund a war then we've got the North Sudanese the ginger wheat the South Sudanese has got a market for bush meat they've got a bunch of refugee camps the protein start and they would take the to meet the Congolese people don't touch the meat they believed they could never seen from from eating giraffe meet they only got the the tail and they will use that tail as a dowry to the bride's father if they want to ask for their for the hand of a bride so having the tails cut only probably indicates that these with companies approaches just a very little to prevent them the long black hairs that are used as a flyswatter it's worth thousands of US dollars the sad part about the the history of karamba is that we've lost the northern white rhino and we now about to lose the last giraffe if we don't get our act together and stop this coaching here is a purely military task we're not after groups of two to three guys ducking in by night taking around getting out again we're after heavily militarized heavily armed groups with specific directive coming off take resources get out i think that's a conservationist and somebody that's dedicated his life to the conservation and whatever form this is deciding this is ripping out your your soul every one of these we find is just one more incentive one more push to go a little bit harder with further and it's never says was alone symmetrical school boo just a second members see there is a tier two separate texts as well as any problem this year after they continue to disregard it and printed in a simple mala visi√≥n pants pocket Thurman security-related recognize yourself recognition telegram it moved me to tears when I was out there and it's brought me to tears again sitting here it's really forcing me to reflect on this experience I'll never forget it i'll never stop being angry i'll never stop feeling the duty to continue but I also feel tremendously obligated to bring it back and try and utilize the resources and the awareness that only national geographic and provide you have to turn tragedy into a galvanizing force we have to turn tragedy into activism alert the world to the tragedy what happened that day and find a new way to let it live on as a source of energy and momentum for all of us there can you police reservist they're armed with automatic rifles they're trained to a very high standard we've set up the dog section highly trained attack stroke tracker stroke patrol units

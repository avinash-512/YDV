Captain TJ ot a hot turner thank you guys for being with us on this last episode we saw Paul Ebert breaking the drought finally catching his first fish what may be a long season but we're gonna get to that in a mall and Paul I had to write this down a the only way I can remember the I love and let me see if I can read of the but we got how many boats have you been on since the show began a thing probably half a dozen half a dozen so you're six boats get any other guesses on what the lander on 6th ed I just think it's a lie I think the right answer and Cesar line to dot com then the bounty hunter season 2 canada.com again on the lease and Jake in season three was the Miss sambuca North versus South you're on the pinwheel with Tyler and now finally the kellyanne yeah so they are those are the Basel how important to be free to get your own ball it would be that's the goal I'm trying to make enough money to buy my own bout are you close on their you there I am mare at some point going to see you in your own boat with the week a personal finally actually be awake it on my life I'm you believe it on my life you guys believe it damn file yeah actually hands are shell you can't just pretend when I can guarantee you haha I live in Los yes I will have my own bile I I don't know but you know what I know I'll it is to own about okay so I'm you know you know it's an insane nothing right cuz a inside its it's done eating to be able to pour all of and make it work make the payments to keep the boat up a ride in PL it's a lot of hot air their looks when when paused on from bow to bolt what what's happened you hear a lot of hearsay in the fishery people talk bad about everyone behind their backs a time now I am NOT an FAA honestly say I've known Paul so there's a little kid he's been on a lot of boats that produced a lot of fish did you he's never been on your boat we've seen on a bunch of other bowing low the items that we all know and love what it look like to have Paul on your ball up be a lot of duct tape lying around yeah amazingly there's no I hate in the world I'll think that would work so it wouldn't work in in you know he I bust his balls right had fun but you know what poll I just have that same type a personality too I think we'd class being same boat yet because we both know mr. own way of doing things a week you know we have that same class there you can add your day area wrapped in Hyannis they have million you rather just like the other guy but ultimately will both have our own way and I think eventually we but heads against that Paul there there are people that are great at being leaders and captains and along the front about there are people there are great at doing what they do in the back of the boat get you believe you have what it takes to be in the front of the boat full time with your own boat all that responsibility in center I've been running boat since I was 11 years old I just never had another money to buy my own ball ever since I was a little kid that's all I my fathers Bo was a $58 for a I ran out when I was 15 out move on to what we saw in this episode upon wanna call it the Muni but you know you're the guys on your ball more specifically was definitely questioning your your leadership at some point and wondering whether or not you were the right fit for his body owns the boat he's brought you on it you hadn't caught a fish yet and as I feel to know a you're struggling the be the guys don't necessarily have you back on that's where the crow like my brother Bruce A nine opposed to me in them guns we get it I ben dry but wants people but in one week I've caught 20 fish you to be a commercial tuna fishermen and do what for a living not just for up pat on the back or a brick chapel wait wait a minute we're in it you said where you say third-team in four hours they are okay opponent okay I i play well we were on a run real blow when you were saying all that yet now I think they like and I was gonna call via but not now but nah I I and II 24 I but realistically Lincoln with my brother Bros we work so good together we can catch a lot of fish we understand when things go wrong like you lose and that it all the time people go dry this is the beginning of the year if you start out with even a dock with a sour taste in your mouth mmm I'm by myself I'm not given up those guys can cry in their wine glass I can I bills to pay this is my if they wanna cry they can stand the dot I'm going to make money cuz I know there's going to be a week a 2-1 at kilowatt TJ has your dad handle dry spells he takes it out on me as a you know a good things are going great a he thanks to take the credit when things are going bad you it both on the pizza on this business is a feast to famine business he's a successful guy he wants it's always going to be going on but I'm very entertained by your dad yeah I love yeah I real deal is assault earlier the NEC is a world-class he would give you anything and the glomerular and tubular about because I was a little amaze for for you your dad your brother it's amazing for you guys are all pretty especially your pic oMG I yeah right before you guys finally get that fish on border seems to be more chaos on your balls and yeah I you know it if you watch most that I was when Dad is on board kinda put this on ed I'm very relaxed a couple times this year we had some hiccups why brother wasn't there with the gap on timer you know I wasn't doing something he has officially years in when you're dead questions you yeah i hook was pushing I got no doubt about it right in doesn't that make you like I'll come on real I can say is seriously can yell at me which is fine you know you yell at me for forever but if I ever yelled at him for a mess up which game are you looking for my teeth on the floor rather it but I can't I saw to you the guy you know why I wrote about and Dave what is your what's your longest dry spell I mean look at I paid years I've gotten three fish for the season you know like your ideas well i i mean anyways I once I've in years I'm quite 35 forty-fifth way it's true revision and Lisa like the year you know when things were going my way in the past realize that they're very I don't believe the tuna right on the dark I'd pile the deal that's on the Boeing Co may I may know that cats dogs fish make money are right away whatever was caught a Pollock unfortunately these days the laws have changed those options art on the table as much as they were before so it does have a little more stressed because we do gotta make this jury thing work just because you know the way the regulations are we can't really jump back and forth his easily as we used to what we've seen when a boat like catching fish they guys just get more more pissed off everyone seems to turn on each other and also on you catch a big hand almost all night everything is just how I love you now where this laptop US and most EU at the most productive at the hook up thirteen thousand dollar fish yeah column science these guys then just jump on the boat wanna go catch a big giant 09 and try to do it for a living been doing this since I was a baby my whole family did my father my mother my grandparents you caught that fish thirteen thousand dollars you bring it back to the to the fish market in the guys is OK we know it was a good idea to give you a thirteen thousand dollars for your fish how does that feel when all the sudden you're able to give him that thirteen thousand dollar paid a Welsh in them get their face you know you saw the guys UK but if we go dry another week they gonna cry again that is all pleasure they got out people %uh fair-weather friend know whether I that's how it is later may alter these guys don't do what for priority for a weapon we do what to feed our families that's it I need a man I don't have anything else we don't have another job this is all we Gott those guys they have jobs they have they have businesses they have other jobs we don't we have just bess I get old saying goes when the going gets tough everybody leaves that's right yeah I like her character the other thing we saw this week we're the to harpoon boats get after each other a little bit he has enough to walk me through and I know you guys don't do that most of the time but I'm a little confused on all I would think so he's got a plane yeah guys don't have a player like that they call themselves the gray whale hunt is right like you know that I'd sit near the boat they don't know what they're talking about when it comes into a pit sure you could call that harden I guess just like you know they get the planes they drive out 100 miles an hour they are plans a passion of mine to grow every you know if you could call you know shooting cows from a helicopter hunting right you know you may be on the same page but those guys you can tell just look at their attitude look at hollywood's attitude right for him it's not about anything accepts a and I caught I caught I caught something I don't even have a job to Hollywood with the play well at the guys who don't have the plane to oh you know I'm not saying that they are it's pretty much hollywood is good at you with the plane Ryan you know the other guys harpoon does take a lot it out a lot I could never do it but you know you also if I was doing it and do it well you wouldn't see me freakin you know parade around like a freaking parallel okay I'll could have a player I mean yeah it's just a dentist rubs me the wrong way by the competition between won both as a plane won both the does there is no comment lol they call it that way think about one place they both have what they could both have a big law and no I understand we were brought up without planes we had to use our eyes we never in we had a hunt for them we may be airplanes in the field in the hall announced as I feel absolutely no knowledge their business that's the biz the Hollywood businesses and what he's doing that is what he does certain ease are made by Dario where you know and again good for him we we all could have the option if we wanted to spend their money and make money like that rape it you know is a YA readers get a lot of it people don't know yes he's the best there is just ask it will tell you yeah my thing is is you really wanna find out who the best it somebody is in any business HDPE other people will tell you he's not going to tell you I'm self eww or more think that our I mean he's he's listed he said a few seasons he was a a nomogram fishermen yep he he is a full-time fish for years passes no doubt about use the fishbowl time and and there are a lot of very good operators in the industry there's no way out that i mean nothing makes me nervous walking out what's in them walk out into a plank that thing is very small and you fall off at the unit run over by the boat right well known as ever can only hope that we have to do without him a natural rubber up no other wishing death other captain I have never done a bit high right out on that day hand doing that is Gabby pre warning I would have to get you know a high fish well good

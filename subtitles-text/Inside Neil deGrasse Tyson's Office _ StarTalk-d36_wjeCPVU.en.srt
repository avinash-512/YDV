so I got a lot of crap in my office people give me things and I collect things and and I don't know where to put it the only horizontal space available is the space in front of books and so so i guess in anybody's house they'd be called tchotchkes but in my office is cosmic office they're all cosmically inspired tchotchkes someone's gave me with this ribbon on top dole pineapple cosmic fun shapes so these are pineapples chunks each cut out the shape of a moon star planet and I just thought to myself yeah universe rocks because would you put like DNA shapes you visit cosmic biology here's a virus shake here I mean universe lends itself to this kind of thing that I've had this can a little too long it's starting to bulge so I think it's time to get rid of this can have had it for like years and years and years no telling what's going on inside of it this is like I guess it's Tabasco sauce but what matters here is like there's a space shuttle on it all right and I don't know how hot the Tabasco sauce is but they've got a space shuttle on it and if it's any temperature as they closely relates to the temperature of the exhaust of the space shuttle then this would vaporize the bottle itself I've got these petrushka dolls i love them i was in Russia visiting outside of Moscow you have Star City where that's like what Houston is to us the the deceit of their space program and these all these dolls stack and unlike so many other petrushka doll that you might find they have like faces of political leaders and people who sort of come and go in history and I thought I've got to get this one because it has Russian space vehicles so of course the littlest one is spotting told the fourth 1957 and then they get bigger and bigger and bigger and the last one is the international space station this is a paperweight with the logo of NASA on it and no one under 30 even understand why paperweights exist and many of them don't even know what one is this is cool on this surface is a blackened circular glass plate with holes in it those are constellations light comes through these holes gets projected in Reverse back out through this lens and goes on the Dome of the planetary this is one of the lenses of the original star projector of the Hayden Planetarium with this is space food sticks I don't know what this is made up but if I'm on earth and I have access to earth food i'm not eating space book that's that's my personal rule i love just a moment of reaching back and see what my hands okay when I got here ok here we go this is 16 / circle and soto sextant you cite the Sun through the filters look at its altitude with time day you can triangulate you get longitude latitude of this one thing anyone object you're looking so I have one just as a reminder that we didn't always have gps tell us where grandma

alright we're going to haul up now and come in weird fishing this fish around there's a couple bites you don't mark that many it's just very strange there's a ton of boats out here everybody's trying to get the last licks in before the end of the season a lot of fish eight other people's Bates they didn't get to us there around but it's still strange ranger at a certain point you make a decision to go in you can't keep torturing yourself waiting for a tuna fish to bite I don't want to go in right now we've been an amazing hot streak and going in means we've accepted that the streak is over you've got baited lines hundreds of feet deep and once you pull those up you're out of the game ok God five minutes why do we do this because Triple on you know that for a great fisherman like Brad this is the worst thing that could happen we missed a huge chance by only a couple of minutes we missed it it happens okay because that was the best like parts had all year and we just put our lines it like it's not fair when we have hooked up probably would we have landed it no I'm not Jesus Christ that was a huge kick in the dick right bald

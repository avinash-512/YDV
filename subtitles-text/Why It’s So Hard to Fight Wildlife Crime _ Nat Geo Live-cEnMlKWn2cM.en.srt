people are selecting specific firearms specific ammunition going out into the forest looking just to kill this gorgeous animal it's not just a simple cops-and-robbers model it's not as easy as you know good guys bad guys we need to be able to put law and order into the equation this is where i started in quality duly in a park in southern republic of congo this elephant is one guy that we would see relatively frequently and as you can see he's got enormous tusks in over three years nobody has seen this elephant it's a national park it's got boundaries but criminals don't care at all about where you draw those lines on a map criminals have much more complex networks and their logistics go as far as they need to we're not talking about a guy hunting to feed his family wildlife trafficking is not subsistence hunting we're talking about addressing the industrial scale problem that we're dealing with leopard skins a very tough one because we're trying to catch the traffickers but at the same time we know that the hunting in the forest is often opportunistic so hitting the traffickers and getting that message back to the poacher so the trigger isn't pulled in the first place or the snare isn't leaving first place is very hard that is not the case of course when it comes to ivory where gorgeous animal we're seeing some giant seizures over in Asia from Central Africa it's coming from Congo gab on right smack in the middle where we have the best elephant populations you get hundreds of kilos of ivory going out all the time accumulating into thousands of kilos inside of big port cities like in low man togo please notice that the ammunition was an ak-47 clip I don't know if you want to call that a leftover from conflict or just an excuse for a big problem that we need to talk about which is corruption you have people in military or police forces providing ammunition to poachers using their authority as a cover so that they can go and make a lot of money off this stuff so who are these guys everybody is this basic notion we have the poachers they give it to a trafficker the trafficker gives it to a middleman he goes to bigger traffickers down the line to your king pin and so from a law enforcement perspective you think right it's easy we're going to intercept these guys with anti poaching on the poachers some police forces along the way and we'll work it out gets a little bit more complicated when maybe someone in your police force is part of your network and I could add a lot of other bubbles and make this far more complicated when you look at who's providing the ammunition who's getting them out of jail who is making it so that even if they get that strong prison sentence that they can still slip away or get a fake medical slip personally we have seen every permutation of corruption that you can imagine there's an operation which we did with the National Central Bureau of Interpol and concrete we're over thirty thousand dollars overseas and over 800 pieces of ivory this fellow is and that i really want to put in jail i have put him in jail a couple times and he's still doing that he's smiling there but he's not smiling here when we're trying to arrest him this is a failure of ours we failed with this guy he is too powerful we have been trying everything to get him arrested his name is e comma our dogs have come in and scan the place found hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pieces of ivory but this fellow got out of jail because his son is an ex rebel leader an ex-member of parliament and he's using every bit of political weight that he can get to traffic his influence across the Congo to make sure that his father doesn't go to jail even though his father's one of the biggest ivory dealers in Congo at the same time he he has the audacity to go to the police station a few weeks later and figure out how to get his ivory back so these are the types of problems but we have to we have to figure out is babysit these cases every single step of the way to make sure that he doesn't get his here's a success a hundred and twenty six kilos of ivory seized in Brazzaville big trafficker he's got a connection to camera into Nigeria it was probably going to go on to go to Togo and all of that stuff we get the dogs in the search the guy gets two years in jail the dogs do lovely stuff on their own we took them into forestry concessions you can't hide anything from these dogs and that enables us to prove that these camps were not actually working for logging concessions are just doing their job and lit them on fire obviously I like playing with the dogs amazing to have live animals around in our work that's the US ambassador as well he's shaking hands with Sean and that's really important for us we need political leverage we need that kind of political weight and that's kind of the take home message here is that with all of this complicated reality of how illegal wildlife trafficking networks function we have to accept that it's not just the simple cops-and-robbers model bad guys it's really complex we need a lot of political pressure to make sure that we're actually able to put these guys behind bars and neutralize them for as long as possible into the equation so spread the word about that please and let's not make it a simple thing let's address this problem with the reality that this thank you very much

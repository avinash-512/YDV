this is the home of one of the most remarkable animal athletes on the planet this is a fishing bat here in a forest in southern belize she's coming out of her home in the cedar tree to pinpoint the sound of her prey here's what she's after fish meeting at the surface of the water the mother bad readies to swoop down and capture Emil she has to fuel up so she can make milk for her hungry baby he called up now with the speed timing and artistry of an all-star football league receiver she scales she scars well let's see that again truth be told this mother path is even more artful than NFL tight end because she's using perfect timing to grab a prize that doesn't want to be grabbed another bathroom sometimes catch you need 30 fish in one night lest you think that's unfair for the pitch well think again sometimes pray bites back even as these bats flutter around in search of their next meal these catfish eyeball the bats waiting for one to slip up the bats slope down to refresh themselves only vaguely aware of the catfish I mean what's to worry about the bats are quick agile and air worthy the catfisher slow sluggish and seba then one bath dives with too much enthusiasm it becomes waterlogged and can't achieve liftoff now the catfish have a chance the bad rashes and frustration the catfish stir the more the battle royals the waters the more it excites the fish the catfish move in for the capture the bad tries to scramble up a rock but it's too slippery the slow deliberate catfish grounds the quick agile bat in its jaws what the spike of their powers the man out of its reach at the last possible second doggy bat flies off and hangs itself to dry pondering a near-death experience
